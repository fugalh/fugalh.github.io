  content: Of course it's okay in writing - the idea is that, when you originally
    composed the sentence, you did not intent to make a pun. Same as when speaking.

  content: "My wife is taking a class wherein writing projects are graded (in part)
    by the students themselves.  One of the comments on her most recent work was about
    her use of \"conventional spelling\".  The grader didn't say whether this was
    good or bad but the implication was that it was somehow unusual.\r\n\r\nAs this
    is a 500-level MBA course, I can only fear for the future of business communications."

One of my pet peeves is when people write "no pun intended." This phrase is fine in realtime communication, like speech or IRC or instant messaging, because you may indeed have not intended the pun.

But when you're writing something like an email or a blog post, you simply cannot honestly say "no pun intended." If the pun truly escaped your intention, then you would not have had a chance to put "no pun intended." If you're trying to be funny by intentionally making a pun and/or drawing attention to your clever pun, then the pun was indeed intended, and if you say "no pun intended" you're a big fat liar.

Don't stop making puns. I love puns. Just leave them to be discovered by the reader, or put "pun intended" if you feel the need to draw attention to it. A pun is a beautiful thing. Never be so ashamed of your puns that you feel the need to pretend you didn't intend them!

In the interest of full disclosure, the abhorrent lack of puns in this post was not intended. I tried halfheartedly to think of one but failed. Oh well.
