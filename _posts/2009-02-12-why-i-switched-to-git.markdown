I love it when someone else writes what I've been meaning to write, so I don't have to write it. 

<a href="http://www.rockstarprogrammer.org/post/2008/apr/06/differences-between-mercurial-and-git/">This article</a> covers the reasons why I switched from mercurial to git, about as well as he could possibly hope to without consulting me, reading my mind, or being me. It's a bit creepy.

He explains it very well (probably better than I would) and has more insight into the technical details than I do.

While we're on the subject, you should all go read <a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">git for computer scientists</a> so you can think like a git. If you already have a CS background, it's quite painless I assure you.
