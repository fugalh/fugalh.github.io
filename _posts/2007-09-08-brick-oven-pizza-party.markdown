<p>I already blogged about finishing my brick oven, but I was perhaps a bit premature in that I hadn't actually had a real success actually cooking in it. But I was so confident that not only did I blog it, but I invited some friends over yesterday for a pizza party. We weren't disappointed.</p>

<p>About 1630 I lit the fire in the oven. I had about 4 2–3 inch pieces laying down in the back, and smaller pieces in front of that, and kindling in front of that, and a newspaper tied in a knot in front of that. It quickly caught on, without much tending at all. The transition from small to 2–3 inch pieces needed a bit of help—I needed more medium small pieces or I needed to arrange things differently. But a few well-placed pieces of kindling kept things going until the bigger pieces were blazing away. The fire was just about to die down to embers at 1730, a whole half hour before my guests were to arrive. The top of the oven was just barely starting to get white, so I'm not sure if it was hot enough at that moment to cook pizza or not. For timing reasons in any case I threw a bit more wood on. In the future I'll get even closer in timing and amount of wood guessing, but falling a little short is a whole lot better feeling than falling a lot long as I have in the past.</p>

<p>They arrived, I showed them the oven and we talked about it for awhile, and then the fire was down to just about the right spot for cooking pizza (and the white spot was now about half of the ceiling), so we began making the pies and I began moving the coals to the side and making sure we'd still have some flame. </p>

<p>My dough was too wet, probably because it's been really humid and I didn't adjust for that. It was hard to manage (sticky) but manage we did. We got the first pizza in the oven and held our collective breath. It didn't turn out to be a 3-minute pizza—more like 6 minutes—but it was a roaring success. The edges were browned and slightly charred, the toppings were brown and crispy (mmmmm! crispy pepperoni), the dough was cooked through. </p>

<p>The bottom, although cooked through, was not browned or charred as one would hope. I think this might be because the dough was too wet, but it might also be because the floor isn't getting hard enough. I think the latter is the case because of the bread experience (coming up). I think the heat is being drawn down into the concrete foundation (aka my patio) and ground, and I would have to fire it for a quite long time to saturate that, especially since less heat goes into the floor than the ceiling anyway. So the next step will be to get some cinder blocks and perhaps pour another slab (if I must), and get some insulation (in the form of air) underneath that floor.</p>

<p>We did 4 excellent pizzas (about 12 inches each) without any problem. I did of course have to keep adding small pieces of wood to the coals to keep a little flame going. Finally after the pizza was done I spread the embers out over the floor and let that soak for a few minutes (not very many). Then we scooped the coals and ashes out and put the bread in and closed the door. Half an hour later we pulled out some delicious sourdough bread. It too did not have the expected hot-hearth effects, but it was cooked through and the top was crispy and brown. The oven thermometer accompanying the bread read 425°F when we took it out. A hotter hearth would have been nice, again, but still a success. Honestly, I get better bread out of my dutch oven in the house oven, but I think it's a matter of getting the floor hotter and practice. </p>

<p>I estimate the cost for firing the oven was about $1, maybe less (at summer firewood prices). The pizza was fantastic (better than I can pull off in our oven with baking tiles), the bread was just fine, and the house didn't get hotter. Success!</p>
