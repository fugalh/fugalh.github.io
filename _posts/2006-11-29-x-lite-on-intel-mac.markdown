<p>X-Lite is the best currently available free SIP softphone for OS X. Version 2
does not work on the Intel Mac though; it crashes constantly. So, with a little
digging through Google I was able to find the <a href="http://support.xten.net/viewtopic.php?t=7899&amp;sid=4e0b074d42e56e135e4548a9b7e89f4b">X-Lite version 3 beta for OS
X</a>,
which does work.</p>

<p>This is good because I have a softphone. But it's bad because now I have less
motivation to port <a href="http://www.twinklephone.com/">Twinkle</a> to OS X. It looks
like a not-too-difficult port and I'd love to have all the power of Twinkle at
my fingertips. Maybe I'll get to it over the next couple of months. Maybe you
will. If you do, be sure to let me know!</p>
