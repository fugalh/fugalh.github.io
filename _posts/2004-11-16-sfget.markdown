<p>I downloaded one too many <code>?download</code> files with wget from SourceForge today. I
respect their desire to make money from advertising, and their desire to have
people use mirrors. However, their interface is really lame. Therefore, since
they don't respect me by making a good UI, I will subvert their ads with <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/sfget">this
nifty shell script</a>, and you can too.</p>

<p>If you're into writing Firefox extensions, do me a favor and write one that
short-circuits that ugly SourceForge download page with a configurable mirror
choice. I'd be happy to host it here.</p>

<p>If your from SourceForge, get a clue. We don't like your download system.</p>
