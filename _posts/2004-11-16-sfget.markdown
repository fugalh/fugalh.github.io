<p>I downloaded one too many <code>?download</code> files with wget from SourceForge today. I
respect their desire to make money from advertising, and their desire to have
people use mirrors. However, their interface is really lame. Therefore, since
they don't respect me by making a good UI, I will subvert their ads with this
nifty shell script, and you can too.</p>

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# sfget - get files a la wget, from stupid sourceforge download links

# Requirements: cut, wget
#
# Usage: sfget <url> <wget options>
#
# Configuration:
mirror="http://voxel.dl.sf.net/sourceforge"


# Here lies the code
orig_url=$1
shift
project=`echo $orig_url | cut -d \/ -f 4`
file=`echo $orig_url | cut -d \/ -f 5 | cut -d \? -f 1`
url=$mirror/$project/$file

exec wget $* $url
```

<p>If you're into writing Firefox extensions, do me a favor and write one that
short-circuits that ugly SourceForge download page with a configurable mirror
choice. I'd be happy to host it here.</p>

<p>If your from SourceForge, get a clue. We don't like your download system.</p>
