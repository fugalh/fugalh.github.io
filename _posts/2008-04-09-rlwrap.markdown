<p>Thanks to Tene for pointing this out to me. It seems like a really useful tool. I am playing with <a href="http://clojure.sf.net">Clojure</a> in my spare time (ha!), and its <acronym title="read-eval-print loop">repl</acronym> doesn't have readline support (or anything like it). The clojure website suggests some Java readline-like jar, but I like this solution much better. I just made a script to wrap clojure in <a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/">rlwrap</a>, and it's working great.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat ~/bin/clojure
#!/bin/sh
exec rlwrap java -jar ~/src/clojure/clojure.jar
</code></pre>
