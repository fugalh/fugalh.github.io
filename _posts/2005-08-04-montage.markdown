<p>Kudos to ImageMagick for all the cool tools like this one. But I want to know
what the author of montage was on when he decided that the default behavior
should be to shrink the final image by one fourth or more. There's no obvious
option to prevent the shrinkage either. But if you use <code>-geometry +0+0</code> the
shrinkage magically goes away. How's that for logic. I still can't even see a
reason why that parameter should help, let alone why I should be required to
know it just to get what I think is perfectly obvious default behavior. Oh
well.</p>
