<p>My <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2004/09/14/sourdough-01.html">sourdough
calculator</a> had a
major bug in the calculations. If you followed its instructions you got much
higher hydration than you asked for. e.g. if you asked for 68% hydration at 20%
starter inoculation, you got a dough that was 74% hydration. Oops. It's been
fixed and can be downloaded at <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/sourdough">the same
place</a>. Other changes include different
defaults (500g 68% hydration loaf with 20% start) and volume measurements for
the scale-deprived.</p>
