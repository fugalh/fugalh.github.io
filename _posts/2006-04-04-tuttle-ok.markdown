<p><a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=127">This email exchange</a> is pretty amusing. The debate in the comments is fairly tiring, actually. You have the LOLs and the apologists, but nobody seems to take the middle road.</p>

<p>Here's my take: Jerry acted like an idiot. He should have called in IT. Johnny was mostly polite and very patient, but he made a mistake: he tried to reason with a panicking idiot.</p>

<p>If I were Johnny, here's what I hope I would have done. I would have gone along more or less like Johnny did until the FBI threat came. That would have been my signal that I'm dealing with an irrational person and I would have then said something like "Neither I nor CentOS has done anything to your server. I will not entertain any further correspondence unless it comes from your IT department."  Inside I would be secretly hoping that he calls the FBI. I've always wanted to meet an FBI agent. We could go to lunch with an FBI IT guy and have a good laugh.</p>
