<p>Remember <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/density/">that system</a> I came up with for calculating body fat percentage using a gallon jug in a swimming pool? I always let the computer do the calculations for meâ€”I have a little script that I run that updates my weight graph. But not everyone is as geeky as that, and formula is not <em>that</em> simple, and when you add units conversion in it gets downright hairy.</p>

<p>I finally figured out how to generate a <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/density/nomogram.html">nomogram</a>. Now you have no excuses.</p>
