<p>This week's <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Las+Cruces&amp;state=NM&amp;site=EPZ&amp;textField1=32.3361&amp;textField2=-106.756">forecast</a> is highs between 104°F and 106°F. The <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NMZ032&amp;warncounty=NMC013&amp;firewxzone=NMZ112&amp;local_place1=Las+Cruces+NM&amp;product1=Special+Weather+Statement">special weather statement</a> says it's expected to be the hottest week of the year. Ugh.</p>

<p>Expect a post, if I survive, on keeping butter at "room temperature" without it melting completely. I have an experiment in mind and these are just the conditions in which to execute it.</p>
