<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/09/18/1623244">this article on Upstart</a>, a replacement for <code>init</code>. </p>

<p>I've long been dissatisfied with the System V init scheme. I've looked at
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/file-rc">file-rc</a>,
<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> (which is similar to
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a>), and briefly at some others
that have popped up from time to time (I think I remember one that had to do
with purple cows, but my memory is hazy). None of them has really done anything
for me. file-rc is a nice concept taken not quite far enough (it's almost as
much a pain editing that file format as dealing with symlinks), and it's not an
init replacement in any case. runit/daemontools are very handy, and I use them,
but when I tried to replace init with runit I made short work of hosing my
startup system. As easy as it is to write run scripts, I do not want to write
one for each daemon that I do now or ever will install.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">upstart</a> is very promising. Its coolness
factor is higher than any of the others, and it has an upgrade path. In fact,
Ubuntu will be using upstart in the upcoming release of Edgy Eft, and is
already in use in Ubuntu testing, completely replacing sysvinit. Kudos to the
Ubuntu folks for recognizing the need for something better and implementing it.
I hope that replacing sysvinit with upstart (in an apt-get sort of way) in
Debian becomes a reality soon.  In any case, I'm going to give it a test on my
laptop when I get some spare time.</p>
