  content: <p>I love Crutchfield.  They're rarely the cheapest, but you can tell that
    they put a lot of research and effort into making sure you get the right stuff
    and know how to install it properly.  They've also got a beautiful guide to installing
    home theater systems with hidden wires and such.  When I lived in Charlottesville,
    VA, we used to go to their outlet store for all our electronics.  Good stuff.</p>

    and since it went so well, I then bought the same one for my crappy truck.</p>

<p>Crutchfield has always stood out to me as a company that knows customer
service. They have knowledgeable people ready to help you do the laughable:
install your own car stereo. Really, it shouldn't be laughable, but in our day
the DIY spirit is pitifully suppressed. Most stores would pity you, mock you,
and/or disparage you for indicating you were going to install that car stereo
on your own, let alone help you do it. </p>

<p>Today Crutchfield has outdone itself in my eyes. I ordered a stereo from them
after much deliberation (thanks to their handy website), which was backordered
probably until the 30th. I might have got it from Amazon, who had it in stock
and would ship for free, but I preferred to go with Crutchfield because I know
I can count on them and their shipping was reasonable ($7) and I had a $20
coupon. I decided I could wait. The part of my order that wasn't back ordered
was shipped by UPS Ground on the 20th and should arrive today. Imagine my
surprise when I check my email that today they shipped the stereo itself by UPS
2nd day air, at no cost to me. I was willing to wait until the 30th and have it
shipped by ground, but they shipped it by 2nd day air even though it came in 3
days <em>earlier</em> than they estimated it would. And they did this without any
prodding or out of any sense of obligation, just as a matter of course. This,
my friends, is how you earn repeat business. This is the second stereo I've
gotten from Crutchfield (I was pleased with their service the last time) and
I'm sure it won't be the last.</p>

<p>Would you like excited and exuberant users of your software? Would you like quality bug reports? Would you like patches coming in so fast you have to study Linus Torvalds to figure out how to survive? Then treat your users and contributors as Crutchfield treats their customers.</p>
