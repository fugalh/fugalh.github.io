<p>I've been using <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a> for my IRC needs in OS X for
some months, but I always have this nagging feeling that I should be using
something a little bit more perfect. See, Colloquy is high on the OS X
interface scale, but surprisingly low on the geeky features that matter scale,
especially considering its roots in <a href="http://irssi.org/">Irssi</a>. At long last I
decided it's time to give <a href="http://adlr.info/?Irssix">Irssix</a> a try again. I
quickly remembered why I abandoned it before--I don't like the font and white
background--but as I was really yearning for the ol' Irssi experience again I
quickly overlooked that.  If I get really ambitious I'll pay my dues and add a
font and color dialog. </p>

<p>In any case, I'm staying with Irssix. It's faster, and I mean <em>lighting</em> fast
compared to Colloquy. I reckon it also takes much less RAM. Colloquy had a
tendency to get up there in RAM usage, and I'd occasionally have to restart it.
And of course, it's basically the Irssi we all love in every single way.</p>
