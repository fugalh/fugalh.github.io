<p>Or more specifically, huzzah for the Debian developers involved in finally
doing what I would have done years ago in their place: <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00002.html">forking cdrtools and
showing Jörg Schilling the door</a>. </p>

<p>Jörg has caused me endless troubles because of his antics. My burner works,
then doesn't work, then works partially, then doesn't work at all. The only
change is the kernel version or the cdrtools version, and the only reason is
that Jörg is on some loony ego-stroking crusade. Good riddance.</p>

<p>Thank you Debian, and thank you Sun for giving Jörg the rope to hang himself
with.</p>
