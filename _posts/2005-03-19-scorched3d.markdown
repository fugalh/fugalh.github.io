<p><a href="http://www.scorched3d.co.uk/">Scorched 3D</a> is a fabulous modernization of the
classic DOS game Scorched Earth, "The Mother of All Games". It features 3D
graphics and gameplay, LAN/Internet play, and in most ways it is faithful to
the memory of Scorched Earth. </p>

<p>Scorch, as we used to call it, was one of our favorite games growing up. With 7
kids all wanting to get in on the action, it was one of the few games we could
play cooperatively. It was a favorite tactic of mine, when it became obvious
that I might get kicked off the computer to let someone else have a turn, to
suggest we play scorch. It usually worked, too.</p>

<p>Scorched 3D is wonderful in every way that scorch was, and then some. The only
fault I can find with it is that the computers are too dumb. Surviving in a
match with 5 true cyborgs bearing down on you was one of the true joys of the
original scorch. Oh, and for some reason things go haywire unless I turn off
the water, but I <em>can</em> turn it off, so that's ok.</p>

<p>Scorched 3D runs on linux, so I don't think I'll be playing classic scorch much
anymore. I rank this game right up there with BZFlag and Liero, taking the
place of its noble predecessor.</p>
