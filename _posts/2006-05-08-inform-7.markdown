  content: <p>Ah, this brings back memories... :)  A few months ago I'd wondered if
    the interactive fiction community was even alive anymore, and then I read your
    post and was thrilled.</p>

    <p>Oh yes, very alive. In fact, there's a yearly competition that has yielded much better IF than the original stuff, IMHO.</p>

    <p>I'm just getting up to speed on Inform, but I believe if you want to use "Put" instead of "Insert", just write a bit of code that goes something like: "Understand  "put" as inserting."</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there is really no need to guess the proper word, because the IDE comes with a handy index. And if you add your own verbs, those verbs will get added to the index, together with a link back to the source code (useful if you want to dig through someone else's code, I guess).</p>

    <p>Syntax is tougher, but the documentation provides enough examples to crib from, and they are all arranged by topic.</p>

    <p>This means that even if you are already a programmer, if you don't have the time or patience to learn a new language you can get up to speed pretty fast on this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7/Inform%207.html">Inform 7</a> is the next
generation of the popular Interactive Fiction compiler.  But it's more than
that. It's an amazing declarative natural language compiler with an incredible
IDE. I've worked with Inform 6, and it was nifty, but when I saw Inform 7 my
jaw dropped. </p>

<p>I've heard about natural language this and that, and learned about logic
programming in school, but this is the first time I've seen either put to
practical use (IMHO).  If you have any interest in either Interactive Fiction
(like Zork) or the language features, do check it out.</p>

<pre><code>"Sourdough" by Hans Fugal

The Kitchen is a room. "This is your kitchen. What a mess."

The baking peel is a portable supporter in the kitchen. "Your
trusty baking peel is here." The lump of dough is on the peel.

The oven is an openable closed scenery container in the kitchen.
"The oven is set to 400 degrees."

Instead of taking the dough: say "But you'd ruin it!"

Before taking the peel: say "You carefully lift the peel."

The baking stone is a supporter in the oven.

instead of inserting peel into oven when dough is on peel and oven
is open: say "You expertly slide the dough off of the peel onto the
baking stone in the oven.";  now the dough is on the baking stone.

After closing oven when dough is on stone: say "Over the next hour
the air fills with the aroma freshly baked sourdough bread. Your
admiring butter-slatherers come out of the woodworks."; end the
game in victory.

<p>The Brass Lantern has <a href="http://brasslantern.org/writers/howto/i7intro.html">an excellent
writeup</a>. </p>

<p>I have been known to delve into writing IF on occasion. Will I use
Inform 7? I might. Or I might use the IDE to write Inform 6 games. It
is a little verbose, and there is a bit of "guess the word" or "guess
the syntax", which can be frustrating as you probably know if you've
ever played IF. But I imagine the set of those is not hard to learn.
For example, it took me some digging to figure out "inserting" because
it didn't like "putting", "placing" or anything else that came
directly to mind. "victory" was similarly hidden to me. </p>

<p>My memory of Inform 6 is incomplete, so this may be inaccurate, but
what I really like about Inform 7 which I think is new, is the logic
programming approach. A game is basically a bunch of descriptive
declarations (building the world) and a bunch of rules about what
happens. This is powerful and elegant in some domains, and IF is one
of those I think. I may program an adventure in Inform 7, but if I do
you can bet I'll be cutting corners wherever I can (you can see I've
done that even in my small experiment above - leaving out the articles
at the end).</p>
