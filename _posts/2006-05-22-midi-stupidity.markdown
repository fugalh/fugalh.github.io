<p>I love my little <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Radium61-main.html">M-Audio Radium 61 MIDI
Controller</a> (keyboard
for you uninitiated). I just (re)learned a disturbing truth about it though: it
has <em>two</em> MIDI outputs and <em>zero</em> MIDI inputs. This is just plain silly. One
MIDI out is the keyboard's output, and the other passes through what's coming
from the USB. </p>

<p>I suppose two MIDI outs is better than one, and it looks like no controllers in
this class ($100-$300) have MIDI in. This completely changes my ideas for
laying out my studio. Now I'm going to have to have the <a href="http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,,CNTID%253D63175%2526CTID%253D205900,00.html">Yamaha
P-70</a>
connect directly to the computer which means getting an adapter to go in
through the sound card or one of those MIDI channel boxes for multiplexing
MIDI. </p>

<p>Oh well, what's another $20 when I need a $1000 pedalboard to complete The
Organ?</p>
