  content: I had significant issues with this software, but very different from yours.
    When I received a rejection the first time, it told me why the form had been rejected,
    so I made the change and refiled. The form was then rejected again; however, there
    was no indication as to why. So I used the start over button and re-filled out
    every form. I then got a new rejection with a different error message than the
    first, made the correction and re-filed only to be rejected again without note
    of the reason. Third time's a charm? No. Did the whole start over method, tried
    to file and now it won't even accept the file.

  content: Yea, you can't type fast or it'll mess up your data...totally unusable.  I
    actually resorted to downloading the PDF's and entering data into those, printing,
    and mailing...so old-fashioned.

  content: 'This site (freefileetc) is complete crap.  My girlfriend, who is disabled
    and has had three MAJOR bowel resection surgeries, and yet still works part-time
    as an elderly care nurse, had me file her taxes. Oh, by the way, she has a dependent
    child that she supports. Anyway, I typed slowly - as you have to do with this
    junk - and the form was complete. I printed it and everything looked correct,
    but apparently during transmission, it transposed HER ss# where her dependent''s
    ss# should be. After the inevitable rejection and resubmission and rejection again,
    we called IRS and spoke with IRS Operator #3110793 who directed us to Operator
    Dave #0155814 (nice guy &amp; helpful)who stated: "it appears that the taxpayer''s
    ss# has been incorrectly entered into the dependent''s ss#". When told that we
    had a hard copy of the tax form filled out correctly from the site, he couldn''t
    explain the error(s). I did suggest that it was probably a software problem and
    since the IRS (oh, yeah - the citizen taxpayers) are paying for the privilege,
    they might want to see the number of complaints and, instead of charging us a
    late filing fee, fine the company that''s peddling and getting paid for this pile
    of feces.'

  content: I did the free fillable forms and got rejected because my dependents social
    security number is supposedly wrong.  I have gone over it with a fine tooth comb
    and don't see any visible error in the number.  I refiled to see if it rejects
    again although I did not find or change any error.  I did free fillable forms
    last year and it actually worked.  Compared the printout from last year to this
    year and the dependents name, social security number and relationship look exactly
    the same on both printings.  Could there be an invisible character somewhere?

  content: After I filed, I never got any confirmation e-mails.  After calling the
    IRS a couple of times (their usually solutions was "give it a couple of days"),
    one of their representative said it was rejected because I had typed the date
    of birth wrong.  After telling me she did not know much about the system because
    she uses "the old fashioned way", she said to find your error, fix it and e-file
    again.  I did and it returned an error message stating I had already filed and
    if I needed to make changes, I needed to mail an amended return.  The next representative
    I spoke with gave me the stock answer "give it a couple of days" to catch up and
    try again.

  content: "All of you have been lucky to have missed two more dedicencies in FFFF.
    1) Schedule E puts an incorrect number on Line 17 of Form 1040. And you can't
    manually enter the correct number.  2) Now for the biggie: *****There is no fucking
    tech or customer support for this POS. not the IRS  and not the anonymous paid
    preparer*****. One of you commentors was lucky to find someone on the phone who
    would talk to you. At the 800 829 1040 help number, I was told that they do not
    support FFFF, and that I should write my congressman if I did not like their answer.
    When I e-mailed the IRS help desk, I received in return a form e-m that said the
    same thing, even though it took a paragraph to say it.\r\nAfter 19 years as a
    volunteer tax counselor for the truly free AARP TaxAide program, I retired after
    the last tax prep year and now I am back to a paper return this year. (I can't
    get my own return done by TaxAide because the IRS and AARP bureaucrats who set
    the rules for what TaxAide can do have outlawed doing residential rental income,
    probably because they think that depreciation is too difficult for amatures to
    calculate.)"

    8863 (Education Credits - American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)
    and that I tried to claim both credits (you can only claim one or the other).
    \ I am looking at the form online. My SSN is correct, and I didn't fill out anything
    related to the Lifetime credit - only the American Opportunity credit.  This my
    second year claiming the credit, and the IRS had no problems with my paper copy
    last year.\r\n\r\nI google'd my way to this post and had to add my 2 cents about
    how FFFF incorrectly transmitted the information I provided.  Umm.. declaring
    how much you owe the government and vice-versa is a bit too important to have
    such garbage in place.  The IRS should take this off their site as a primary e-filing
    service.\r\n\r\nP.S. Nothing happens when I click Print Returns using Firefox.

  content: "I have always done my taxes myself by hand. I tried tax prep programs
    a couple of times and hated them, going so far as throwing out their results.
    What I have done for years is put my numbers into a spreadsheet and let it do
    the calculations for me. So when I started FFFF I already had my numbers, including
    calculated results. I found it fairly straightforward to copy everything into
    their forms, just the way I would normally copy it into the IRS fillable PDFs.
    I checked all their math, and it agreed with mine, including Schedule E.\r\n\r\nBut
    then came the hard part. Instead of just printing the forms, stapling the 1099R's,
    signing, and putting on a stamp, I discovered that I would have to enter every
    blasted bit of information from every 1099R into their forms. Between us my wife
    and I have five of those, with long names and addresses, three account or ID numbers
    on each in addition to the dollar numbers, and to add insult to injury I had to
    refill our own address on every one.\r\n\r\nTwo hours, much squinting, crosschecking,
    and retyping later I swore I would NEVER do this again."

    using the same pin and last agi I used to successfully file for extension.  So
    it has no excuse to reject them.  I've tried removing and retyping them in.\r\n\r\nFurthermore
    the first time I submitted, I got a rejection email but the online status check
    said congrats it's been accepted.  After calling and being told to resubmitted,
    the online status changed to \"can't be found\" alternating with \"congrats it's
    been submitted (not accepted).\"  Third try and it's been rejected with the status
    page repeating the very \"informative\" error messages from the email.  This program
    can't even get consistent at matching it's status to it's status!!\r\n\r\nThis
    is just a bit of the fun I'm having with the rejection codes.  There are two more...\r\n\r\nI

    which was regarding the W2's.  We were finally able to identify the problem on
    the W2 forms.  You must fill out both street address lines on the forms whether
    there is one on the W2 or not.  Just use the same street address on the second
    line as you did on the first.  8 days from the first time we finally got it right!  It
    will be interesting to see how long it will take to get our refund.

    appear to be related to dependents' name and social security number not matching.
    But I've got the social security cards and the entered data is correct. Another
    problem is the rejection email includes error codes, like "0504," but does not
    identify the line in the return with the problem. I guess I'll print it out and
    file by mail. Very frustrating.

    IRS to get some idea what they meant in plain English. Email response was canned
    and no help. Called and sat on hold for an hour only to be told that they also
    have no idea what these codes mean either and can offer no suggestion with regard
    to how to correct them. Last guy I talked to thought it had to do with transmission
    problems from the FFF end. So I tried again. No rejection or acceptance email
    from IRS but FFF status check says rejected, but no indication if this is a new
    rejection or the old one. So I am just going to mail the damn forms in like I
    should have just done in the first place. Total waste of time

  content: I had the same problem with rejection due to non matching SSN of dependent.
    I followed the advice of above. It worked! Type the dependent's name in 2 separate
    boxes.

  content: I concur with a previous commentator who suggested the IRS remove the link
    to this program.  It's incredibly bad and wastes your time.  I'd used other free
    tax apps before that were fine.  Since it was linked right to the IRS site, I
    thought I might as well use it.  Good grief.   I found the user interface a mess
    for correcting entries.

If you saunter on over to irs.gov you'll see that there's a new option for free electronic filing: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=118986,00.html?portlet=8">Free File Fillable Forms</a> (0xFFFF). Unlike the partnerships with companies like H&R Block which limit free filing by your income, this is free for everyone. And unlike those companies, you have to do all the thinking and math. Well, most of the math.

I did this with my taxes this year, mostly out of curiosity and because the notion of electronic filing user-filled forms is elegant and I think we should have been doing it for at least 10 years by now.

Alas, the implementation of this elegant idea is pretty shoddy. I went to FreeFileFillableForms.com via irs.gov and immediately hit a hurdle. While trying to sign up for an account, the captchas consistently failed. I'm not stupid enough to miss 5 captchas in a row. Just for kicks I did the audio captcha instead. Wow, that's a thorough captcha—you have to type a whole phrase from a TV snippet from like 1955. I had to try 3 before I even had a good guess on all the words. (I'm betting you only had to get one word right, though.) That worked. Armed with an account I got started.

Or at least I tried to. It redirected me back to the login page. After a few times around the block I decided it was probably some kind of browser incompatibility, so I ditched  <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> and fired up Safari. That worked (it may have solved my captcha problem, too).

The interface is nothing sensible like PDF forms or standard HTML forms. It's a flash-based GUI. Very slick in some places, but very deficient in actual usability. The most glaring problem is that you can't type faster than about 20 words per minute or it goes all dyslexic on you. This is a serious problem. I had to triple check every word and number entered to be sure it hadn't switched the letters around behind my back. Lest you think I'm a paranoid defective keyboardist, I watched it shuffle the letters around, like something out of the new Electric Company. I typed a word while watching the screen, saw it lay down the letters in the order I typed them, then watched in horror as it rearranged the last few letters. My hypothesis is that it's doing some sort of input verification, but doing it poorly and rife with race conditions.


In spite of all my diligence, I missed the fact that it had rearranged my SSN at the top of the 1040, and so when I submitted it the IRS rejected it and I now have to go back in and fix it, recheck every number, and resubmit.

I said you do the math, which isn't entirely true. You follow the instructions and the forms automatically do most of the math. But not until you actually press "do the math" (that's very 1998). But it's not very consistent about how helpful it is. Some forms automatically fill in your AGI, others require you to enter it manually. Some remember your filing status and enter the right number, others require you to do it manually. Basically, you have to try to enter every number and check box, and the only way you can tell whether you should have tried to enter it is by whether it pops up a little red tooltip telling you it's going to do that for you, thanks.

All in all, with those major caveats, it worked well. The overall interface wasn't horrible, the generated PDF when you print your forms is very nice, and I'm sure once I get my return right in spite of its buggy input validation it'll file without issue. If they had just used regular HTML and Javascript like H&R Block does, it would have been more likely to be less buggy and more compatible with all browsers. I can recommend 0xFFFF, but only to the patient and diligent who really want that refund sooner rather than later. Otherwise go with the paper forms.
