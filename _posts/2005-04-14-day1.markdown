<p>I bought a 12" iBook for my upcoming graduate school adventure. I've wanted a
Mac for some time now, basically since OS X came out. I can't say yet whether I
will like OS X more than Linux or whether I will end up running Linux primarily
on it, but I know Apple has good hardware and that linux support for the iBook
is purportedly excellent with the exception of the broadcom-chipset Airport
Extreme. </p>

<p>I'm going to spend the first week in OS X only, then install Linux. I have used
OS X and Mac Classic briefly on other computers, but this is my first
time as a Mac user and owner.</p>

<p>I will be chronicling my experience here in perhaps the liveliest flurry of
activity this blog will ever see. Sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>
