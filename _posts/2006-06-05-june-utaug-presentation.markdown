<p>Yours truly will be presenting tomorrow (June 6, 2006) on
<em>(Open)SER and MediaProxy: Bugspray for NATs</em> at the <a href="http://utaug.org">Utah Asterisk Users
Group</a>. </p>

<p>SIP is big, SIP is here to stay. Although this is an
<a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> users group, It's important to know the
strengths and weaknesses of Asterisk and its open-source SIP router friend,
<a href="http://openser.org/">SER</a>. Especially because one of the most successful ways
to solve the myriad firewall and NAT-related problems of SIP is with the
<a href="http://mediaproxy.ag-projects.com/">MediaProxy</a> module.</p>

<p>You may not believe it, but with the help of MediaProxy SIP can be used easily
in all but the most insanely firewalled environments. Come to the SLC library
tomorrow at 7pm and learn how you too can conquer NAT. Directions are given in
this <a href="http://utaug.org/?q=node/18">previous meeting announcement</a></p>
