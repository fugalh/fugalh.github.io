<p>At least on Debian, when I upgraded ruby to 1.8.4 (from 1.8.2) I got the infamous <code>Logger::Format not defined</code> error when starting up instiki. My other rails apps work fine, since I have a recent version of rails installed, but instiki ships with its own rails, which is apparently not new enough. Solution:</p>

<pre><code>cd instiki-0.10.2/vendor
mv rails rails.foo
</code></pre>

<p>Voil&aacute;, you're now using your own rails install and it works great. This is where we cross our fingers that this doesn't introduce any bugs...</p>
