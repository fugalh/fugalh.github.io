<p>I was migrating a bind9 setup from Debian to SuSE and couldn't get the
transfers to work. To make a long story short I had to put ipv6 addresses in my
allow-transfer entry, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>allow-transfer {
    ::ffff:172.16.59.5; 172.16.59.5;
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have no idea whether the second ipv4 entry is really necessary but I don't
want to be burned.</p>

<p>A probably-preferable alternate solution is to comment out the line:</p>

<pre><code>listen-on-v6 { any; };
</code></pre>

<p>and leave the allow-transfer the way it was (ipv4-style).</p>
