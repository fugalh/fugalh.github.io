<p>I love <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>. It is a superb piece of software
and a fine example of open source success. However, the <code>extensions.conf</code>
syntax is painful at best. I haven't had to worry about linenumbers since my
GW-BASIC days, and even then it wasn't necessary that line be numbered
sequentially. So I did some thinking about how to solve this problem, and
decided the best approach would be to write a translator that takes something
sane, which I will call *<acronym title="Asterisk Dial Plan
language">ADP</acronym>*, and translate it to standard <code>extensions.conf</code>
format.  Let's look at an example. Instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>[incoming]
exten =&gt; s,1,Wait(1)
exten =&gt; s,2,Answer
exten =&gt; s,3,Playback(greeting)
exten =&gt; s,4,VoiceMail(77&amp;80)
exten =&gt; s,5,Hangup
</code></pre>

<p>we write this:</p>

<pre><code>[incoming]
ext s {
    Wait(1)
    Answer
    Playback(greeting)
    VoiceMail(77&amp;80)
    Hangup
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, adding <code>Zapateller</code> between <code>Answer</code> and <code>Playback</code> does not require
manually reordering priority numbers.</p>

<p>I decided on the language and wrote a grammar for it, then dusted off my
lex/yacc skills (and book) and wrote me a C implementation of ADP. You can find
the current version and darcs repository at <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/adp">http://hans.fugal.net/src/adp</a>. It
works, but there are probably bugs and certainly memory leaks (but unless you
have a gargantuan <code>extensions.conf</code>, who cares?)</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful. Suggestions and patches welcome.</p>
