Even as I am trying to get back on top of my email backlog, I find a more effective way to ignore emails and just get work done. The cycle of life, eh?

Those little red badges are annoyingly effective at getting me to drop what I'm doing and check out what's new. When the number is in the hundreds, I can't be bothered to remember what the last count was and so I don't know whether there's new mail, so I'm too frequently opening it to see what's new and whether it needs immediate action. In Thunderbird 2 on OS X, you could configure the new message badge to only show messages new since the last time you looked, not unread messages. Then, if there is a little red circle you know there is new mail that needs attention, and if not there is nothing new. Much more productive.

Initially in Thunderbird 3, this feature was removed by haughty but well-meaning developers who couldn't fathom why anyone would want to see anything but the number of unread messages. There was a beta user hissy fit (I participated), the usual stubborn standoff, a patch, and a whole bunch of inaction. I gave up and went on with my life. Apparently, sometime in the interim reason prevailed and it's back in Thunderbird 3.1. The preference is mail.biff.use_new_count_in_mac_dock.
