  content: <p>It's also a good thing to know that other married geeks experience the
    same thing I do.  I have a quota on how many "geeky" things per day I can subject
    my wife to, and I was all out yesterday, but the nerd handbook is at the top of
    today's list...</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://scottr.org/blog/2007/nov/29/nerd-handbook/">spr</a>, I got a good laugh, and creepy feeling, reading <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html">about myself</a> on <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">a stranger's blog</a>. It's nice to know there are people out there just like you, but it can be disconcerting at the same time. <a href="http://erin.fugal.net/">My wife</a> thought I was laughing at the episode of The Cosby Show she was watching, which I sometimes was. I had her fooled.</p>

<p>I enthusiastically referred my wife to read it, but she seemed to be only mildly amused. I guess she found the truth less funny and more sobering, and who can blame her? To all of you out there who have fallen for a geek, my condolences and congratulations. I think we're a pretty good lot, and you couldn't do better, but it can be a strange thing to be married to a geek. To my geek friends, don't forget to at least try to make it easier on her, and worth her while.</p>

<p><a href="http://weightfamily.blogspot.com/2007/11/fall-time-fun.html">A friend recently asked me</a> to share some six things about myself. Normally I would just send her an email with six things and not propogate the forward, but the stranger already wrote it all down! The only thing I have to add is that I watch an episode of some classic Sci-Fi show nearly every day, usually during a meal. Usually Star Trek or Doctor Who. Erin likes Star Trek well enough and humors me. Jonny likes Doctor Who better, so when Erin's out (or not paying attention) we cozy up on the couch for some foam monsters. There's just something about that <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/tmp/doctor_who.mp3">theme music</a> and the Tardis sound effects that makes even the tackiest foam monster worth watching.</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that my wife is still my number one project. Other projects will come and go. Some will seem more important to her and even to me, at times. Mistakes like those aside, I plan to keep her number one, forever.</p>
