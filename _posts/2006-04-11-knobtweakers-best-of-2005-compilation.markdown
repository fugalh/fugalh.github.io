    <p>Hey, thanks for the write up.  =)  You might be interested to know that Drum and Bacharach isn't a remix of a John B song -- it's an original Young Punx tune that was partially co-produced by the Drum and Bass legend, John B.</p>

    <p>BTW, This site design looks like a fantasy RPG blog.  Cool!  =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dilvie.com/">dilvie</a> got me to add
<a href="http://knobtweakers.net">knobtweakers.net</a> to my RSS feeds a while ago.
Admittedly I usually don't listen to it (I need some good podcast software but
that's another post). But the other day I did listen to the Enicma song <a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/2006/04/enicma.html">Lost
in an Unfriendly World</a>, and I
loved it. So I decided to see what else I might have missed and started digging
around the site.</p>

<p>I downloaded the <a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/2006/01/ktwk001-knobtweakers-best-of-2005.html">Knobtweakers Best of 2005
Compilation</a>
and listened to it today. There's some great stuff in there. Here's what I
particularly liked.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/01_-_Binaerpilot_-_Goof.mp3">Goof</a> by <a href="http://www.binaerpilot.info/">Binaerpilot</a> is absolutely delightful. This is the epitome of what makes electronic music cool. This is the kind of music I dream of making.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/09_-_I_Am_Robot_And_Proud_-_Count_To_Six.mp3">Count to Six</a> by <a href="http://www.robotandproud.com/music/index.php">I Am Robot and Proud</a> is cute and fun. Hippity Hop!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/10_-_Bliss_-_Nerds_Inc.mp3">Nerds, Inc.</a> by Bliss is both enjoyable and hilarious.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyoungpunx.com/">The Young Punx</a>' remix of Madonna's <a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/13_-_The_Young_Punx_-_Dance_With_Someone_Else_(Vocal-Edit%29.mp3">Dance with Someone Else</a> makes me laugh. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/31_-_K-Oscillate_-_Clear_Light.mp3">Clear Light</a> by <a href="http://www.k-o.com.au/">K-Oscillate</a> is a neat synth world sound that holds my interest and exhibits some very interesting synth as well as very analog vocals.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyoungpunx.com/">The Young Punx</a> do it again with an fascinating and fun remix of 60's bossa nova by John B: <a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/32_-_The_Young_Punx_and_John_B_-_Drum_and_Bacharach.mp3">Drum and Bacharach</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also deserving of honorable mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/08_-_Le_Zero_-_For_a_Day.mp3">For a Day</a> by <a href="http://www.lezero.net.tc/">Le Zero</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.knobtweakers.net/netlabel/ktwk001/19_-_Underground_Bass_Masters_-_Digital_Bliss.mp3">Digital Bliss</a> by <a href="http://www.audesi.net/ubm/">Underground Bass Masters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all of the songs are right up my alley, but those are the ones that
really stuck out at me after the first listen. </p>

<p>Oh, and while I'm on the subject, you ought to check out <a href="http://www.helgo.net/gavel/lunar/">Computerville by Lunar Shuttle Disaster</a> which is an excellent and fun piece made in Linux. Enjoy!</p>
