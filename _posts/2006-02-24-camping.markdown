<p>I whipped up my own replacement to "my blosxom" tonight using
<a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org">camping</a>. It was fun and frustrating, as it
always is when working with both ruby and html. It's a little slow,
unfortunately, I'll have to profile where the time is. I hope I won't have to
run yet another FastCGI process, I don't have the RAM for that. Hopefully some
filesystem and pagination optimizations will do the trick.</p>

<p>Pagination was the whole point of moving away from what was already working,
and a desire to escape from school and work for just a bit and do something
pointless. Learning camping seemed good, because it can be even easier to whip
up something small in camping than in rails.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's not exactly working yet. e.g. permalinks and category links don't
work. I'll get to it.</p>

<p>Update: After sleeping on it I switched back to blosxom until I get the time to polish up the camping version. </p>
