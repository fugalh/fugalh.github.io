  content: awesome little article there man.  You seriously did your homework and
    seem to have more satisfactorily answered many of my dental hygiene questions
    than my dentist (or google until today) ever has.

  content: "if you want a sensitive paste with the PN, i've had decent results with
    the colgate variety. i bet the tom's of maine is better. however, i've heard that
    using PN blocks enamel from actually filling the open pores that cause the sensitivity.
    so a medium-low abrasion paste (i'm looking at squigle enamel saver) plus original
    anti-cavity ACT fluoride mouthwash (which is the bomb, but don't rinse with water..
    and the new versions suck) is a good idea. also xylitol is a sweetener know to
    encourage enamel growth.\r\nA dentist, http://askdrellie.blogspot.com, has figured
    out a system of toothcleaning that has good results. I would say it's scam-ish,
    but she doesn't recommend only her product (gums and mints made with xylitol only),
    and she seemed authentic when i spoke with her. anyway, she developed the system
    after finding out what products worked best for her patients.\r\nlong post, i
    know. hope it helps."

    teeth! The baking soda neutralizes the acids in your mouth stopping decay and
    the mild abrasiveness whitens. there is no better product!

  content: Thanks for this, I recently started using Arm &amp; Hammer after using
    Sensodyne for ages. I can't use whitening, that shit makes my teeth ACHE. But
    sadly, sensodyne paste leaves a coating on your teeth/mouth which is kinda icky
    over time. At least in my experience. A&amp;H seems to be one of the few toothpastes
    (at least of the pastes offered in stores where I live) that doesn't have whitening.

  content: "I'm a big Tom's of Maine fan, mostly because they know how to make toothpaste
    that tastes good enough to be dessert.  The fennel is to die for.\r\n\r\nI recently
    tried their low SLS spearmint version and I must say that, in addition to the
    low-sudsing feeling a little strange, the flavor was just not there.  Either they
    were stingy with the spearmint oil or the more earth-friendly seaweed sudsing
    agent's flavor was overpowering.  In any case, I would be hard pressed to use
    it again without a major flavor improvement.  That said, if I see it on the shelf
    in fennel or cinnamint, I'll try at least one tube."

    hydrogen peroxide in your mouth when you brush helps to whiten teeth.  She said
    you can also use it between brushings.  So far, it seems to be working for me,
    too.\r\n\r\nAs far as toothpaste goes, she says it doesn't really make that much
    difference.  The important thing is to brush 2-4 times a day.  Compulsive brushing
    can be bad, especially if you're using a paste with a high RDA factor as you noted.
    \ Good article and good research.  Thanks."

    on our mouth because fluoride but for me, whether it has or not, we should seek
    first the dentist's advice before jumping into conclusions and take some actions.

  content: Shoulda done a bit more research on the Triclosan, but nice article.  Triclosan
    is the primary active chemical added to the majority of hand soaps &amp; cleaners
    that advertise anti-bacterial power.  It's presence on the skin of people who
    are sick, tends to increase the populations of harmful bacteria by killing beneficial
    bacteria that normally block the invasion of random infections.

  content: Excellent article with good research. I think the problem is that baking
    soda alone is too abrasive, while Arm &amp; Hammer (a baking soda toothpaste)
    is okay. All toothpastes have abrasives.

  content: I agree, awesome research and article. I've been using a homemade mix if
    baking soda and peroxide lately with excellent results (flavor's the neg though).
    My teeth feel cleaner longer compared to toothpaste which almost seems to attract
    food to my teeth hence leaving that clean feeling only temporary. (There's something
    for your great researching skills...is there an additive to make us brush more?)  I've
    always been a compulsive brusher, so maybe that's in part the reason. The problem
    with all this is my fear that the baking soda is too abrasive. Trying to balance
    the best of both worlds, brush less with a more abrasive solution than numerous
    times a day with less abrasion. Then again I've always used the whitening toothpastes
    so is it in fact less abrasive than BS...so many questions. Thanks again for giving
    me info to consider! Great job!

<p>So I went to the dentist the other day and he recommended I stop using that awful baking soda toothpaste. Oh how he wishes it wasn't even on the market. It's the worst thing to happen to dental health since dulce de leche!</p>

<p>Whatever. Whenever I heard superlative statements, even when calmly uttered by specialists and authority figures, warning bells go off. On the other hand, the possibility that I might stop suffering from sensitive teeth is enough to warrant some research.</p>

<p>His claim against baking soda is that it's too abrasive. When I came home and started googling, I found that the Arm &amp; Hammer people are saying that baking soda is less abrasive than the silica abrasives most toothpastes use. Somebody's wrong. Both are trying to sell me stuff (the dentist wanted to give me prescription Prevident toothpaste, which of course they sell). Neither can be trusted (ok, maybe the dentist can be more trusted to have my best interest at heart, but in my experience health care professionals for all their heart can't always be trusted to get all the facts straight. Ask them for supporting evidence. If they can't back it up with science, they might be mistaken!). I need facts.</p>

<p>After a bit of googling, I found an <a href="www.science.uwaterloo.ca/WWSEF/03Awards/03mysickarep.pdf">interesting report</a> by some students (undergradutes, by the look of it) at the University of Waterloo. They rigged up a dremel to brush teeth for the equivalent of 82 years and compared straight baking soda, Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, and Topol (a fairly abrasive smoker's toothpaste). They found Arm &amp; Hammer didn't noticeably abrade the teeth, Topol did mildly, and baking soda did severely. Unfortunately, there wasn't a comparison between a baking soda toothpaste and a regular (silica) toothpaste.</p>

<p>Finally I found some information about the Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) index. Armed with this new keyword I started finding more substantial information on the abrasiveness of various toothpastes. <a href="http://www.satyen.com/toothpastes.shtml">This article</a> at Satyen.com has an excellent description of the methods and a nice table of results for many toothpastes, including sources. In addition, <a href="http://www.epinions.com/review/CREST_Pro_Health_Fluoride_Toothpaste_Clean_Mint_7_8_oz/content_422725979780">it is reported</a> (complete with hyperbole) that toothpaste companies will usually give you the RDA values of their toothpastes if you call and ask (but apparently Crest doesn't).</p>

<p>So looking at the Sayten.com chart, which is corroborated by various bits and pieces scattered across the web, baking soda toothpaste is neither automatically better nor worse than other brands. They are all in it together. One thing that you do notice is that whitening formulas have higher abrasion than non-whitening, and sensitive formulas tend to lower abrasion, but there are toothpastes that aren't labeled sensitive that are just as low or lower.</p>

<p>Most interestingly, baking soda alone has a very low RDA of 7. This doesn't jive with the report by the students at the University of Waterloo, but could be explained by a difference in methods. One possible explanation is that baking soda in toothpaste (and presumably that used in the RDA tests) is ground finer than the stuff in the box and/or has more liquid added which allows it to dissolve into finer particles.</p>

<p>Based on the lower RDA numbers that Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes tend to get when they're not whitening, it would seem that baking soda is indeed possibly a gentler cleaning agent than silica, but other factors come into play.</p>

<p>To be fair to my dentist, he did mention that whitening toothpastes were bad for sensitive teeth, and I have indeed been using a whitening variety. He also disparaged tartar control as useless and perhaps bad for sensitive teeth. I didn't research that in depth.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that RDA isn't the whole story. There's also Pellicle Cleaning Ratio (PCR). You want a high PCR and low RDA, i.e. more cleaning power with less abrasion. Obviously it's a balancing act. Water alone has a nice low RDA of 4, but obviously water alone doesn't clean as well as a toothpaste. And we're not talking just get the dulce de leche off, we're talking about removing more stubborn bits and pieces (like tartar).</p>

<p>So let's look at the various things toothpastes claim to do.</p>

<p>Flouride: This is supposed to help strengthen/build enamel. The consensus seems to be whatever you do, get a toothpaste with flouride. The primary difference in prescription Prevident appears to be a higher dosage of flouride (1% instead of 0.25%).</p>

<p>Whitening: This is essentially a sandpaper process. You're literally grinding away the stains. No thanks for me. If you have sensitive teeth and/or don't have severe staining problems, stay away.</p>

<p>Sensitive: Toothpastes containing potassium nitrate (saltpetre) are "clinically proven to sooth exposed dentin". Apparently bacon is good for your teeth! (Actually, bacon is usually cured with sodium nitrite these days.) From my googling, it seems this is primarily good for sensitivity at the base, along the gumline, only. I have noticed sensitivity there of late, but I'm much more sensitive (and have been for years) on the actual chewing surface of my teeth. I might give this a try.</p>

<p>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate: Most commercial toothpaste have this foaming agent. It is claimed to aggravate canker sores, so if you tend to get them you might look for a toothpaste without SLS (probably at a health food store).</p>

<p>RDA: see chart linked to above. A lower RDA means less enamel worn away. Ideally you find a good PCR:RDA ratio, but I haven't been able to find a good source of PCR information.</p>

<p>Triclosan: Colgate Total has this antibacterial stuff that adheres to your teeth. It's supposed to be really keen. It's patented, but I hear the patent is running out this year, so maybe we'll see other brands using it (or maybe I'm misinformed).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ada.org/ada/seal/toothpaste.asp">ADA seal of approval</a>: look for this, it means dentists think it's keen. Oh, and it also means that the toothpaste manufacturer jumped through the hoops and paid the money to get the testing done. So the lack of seal alone cannot be taken to imply a lack of quality, but the presence of seal implies quality (or that the ADA is corrupt).</p>

<p>Toothbrush: the stiffness of the bristles is a factor in the abrasion as well. If your teeth are sensitive it seems you probably want soft bristles.</p>

<p>In summary, I plan to find a toothpaste with flouride, a low RDA value, and an ADA seal. Maybe I'll try something with saltpetre and/or triclosan. I'll probably continue to use an Arm &amp; Hammer brand because I like the taste and the orange tube is handsome.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I am not a dentist, doctor, oral hygenist, dental assistant, or drug dealer. I sometimes forget to brush my teeth at night.  In no way do I claim know what's better for your teeth than you do, let alone dentists and drug dealers. Feel free to learn from this post but don't come whining to me when your teeth fall out. That goes for any other random blogger on the internet, for that matter. For all you know, I could be a baking soda shill, supported entirely by the deep pockets of Messieurs Sodium and Bicarbonate.</p>
