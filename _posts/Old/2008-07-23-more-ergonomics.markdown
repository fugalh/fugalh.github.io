  content: <p>Having taught in classrooms setup "ergonomically" with the monitor placed
    like the illustration, I feel qualified to call horse hooey. When one of those
    classrooms was upgraded to LCDs, they were moved onto the desk. I guess I wasn't
    the only one that found the monitor hard to see when recessed in the desk.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://www.ankrumassociates.com/articles/setting.htm">this article</a> this morning. It is a well-supported discussion of ergonomics, and where and why they've gone wrong in the past. Of most interest is putting the monitor down low, and they make a pretty good case for it. Look at the image and imagine the lower monitor instead as an LCD attached to the keyboard. Look familiar?</p>

<p>I may have to reconsider my plan to put the monitor up at eye level. I'll have to pay more attention to things as I use my laptop. My primary concern is not dipping my head forward, which isn't great for the neck. But, I haven't had much discomfort in using my laptop as primary computer for the past couple of years, aside from elbow/shoulder discomfort because of sinking into the couch (not a problem when at school with a chair and desk, although the desk is a tad too high). A comfortable banana chair (with a high enough back to support my head) is sounding promising. What do you think? Is the monitor low or high better in your anecdotal experience?</p>

<p>Incidentally the bit about indirect lighting is spot on. My favorite is indirect outside light (window orthogonal to monitor), but a natural white bulb in a task light pointed upwards towards the wall in a dark room works well too. Anything but those blasted flickering overhead fluourescents.</p>
