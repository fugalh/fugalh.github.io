<p>The wait is over! <a href="http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/">XiphQT</a> is here. It's got a
little room for improvement, but it's a proper QuickTime codec for QT7 (e.g.
Tiger) that plays Ogg. In particular, iTunes' ugliest corners show through.
Streaming is a bit broken, and there's some metadata problems. But this is
primarily iTunes' fault, and as it's closed-source there's not much one can do
about it.</p>

<p>So now that I have more RAM (didn't I tell you?) and Ogg support, I actually
sometimes listen to music on my laptop now. But mostly I listen on the desktop
with my nifty XMMS xml-rpc remote I hacked up in no time flat thanks to ruby.
As a bonus I get IMMS there too, although it's contaminated with my wife's
preferences too.</p>

<p>I hear tell that <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html">VLC</a>
supports Ogg and isn't half bad. I'll have to give it a try tomorrow. If I like
it you'll hear about it. If I hate it you'll hear about it. Otherwise you'll
know I'm still listening to <a href="http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/albums/html/a_53.html">Sugar
Tax</a> on the desktop
speakers...</p>
