<p>I upgraded to Tiger today. The question on everybody's mind is, would I have
paid for it? The answer is still probably no, but there are some very important
improvements over Panther, at least from my perspective.</p>

<p>First, Dashboard is just as cool as it looks, although not as fast as I'd
imagined (there are noticeable delays in e.g. the hula dancer almost every
time, and CPU usage is nearly pegged while it's open). Spotlight looks useful,
but I'm not yet sure whether the indexing is going to be bad for my battery.
More investigation will be needed there.</p>

<p>Tiger has ruby 1.8.2, and unlike Panther's 1.6 it seems to be fully enabled
with Tk. (I can't say for sure that that's not because I had installed TkAqua
prior to upgrading in an attempt to get Tk working before) The upshot of this
is that you can write ruby GUIs that don't require users to do any voodoo, not
to mention all the benefits of 1.8 over 1.6.</p>

<p>Some say it's faster. I haven't noticed. If anything it seems slower (and my
laptop seems hot). This may be temporary or configurable; more investigation is
in order. I do understand that gcc4 does a superb job of optimizing for the
platform though.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, Tiger supports remapping CAPS to Control right out of the
box.</p>
