  content: "It's been a looooooooong time, but can't you setup Myth to keep the original
    MPEG, and not encode it at all?  That's what I used to do.\r\n\r\nAside from that,
    look at nuvexport, or check out the myth wiki.  It's possible, there's lots of
    stuff that do it.\r\n\r\nAnd (not that you asked), my advice is -- get a Tivo.
    \ You can strip the DRM and get a clean MPEG2.  Whee! :)"

  content: You can indeed just get the mpeg2 output directly from your PVR-* cards.  I've
    never even seen a .nuv file in mythtv since I've been using it for a couple years.  I
    didn't do anything special (of which I'm aware, anyway).

Wanted: something that will reliably remux <code>.nuv</code> files generated by MythTV to some sane container. Bonus points if it can use the cutlist (to eliminate commercials).

My own guess was ffmpeg with <code>-acodec copy -vcodec copy</code>, but alas it's not working. I get sundry errors that don't make sense to mortals but no doubt stem from the horrific hodgepodge that is the NUV container as implemented by MythTV.
