<p>Verified by Visa is pure evil. I refuse to participate. I made a purchase on <a href="http://newegg.com">NewEgg</a> and my stupid bank had signed me up for Verified by Visa "at no extra cost." That's like being told you win a turn in the double-speed tilt-a-whirl at no extra cost. No thank you!</p>

<p>This Verified by Visa screen had no cancel button. I refused to fill out the information so I just left it open and went on with life. I checked my account at NewEgg sometime later and the card was processed ok. So, no thanks to my stupid bank, I was able to make my purchase without joining the zombie ranks.</p>

<p>Yes, I hate my bank. I have two banks that I love and one that I hate. The one I hate is the best one in town. C'est la vie.</p>

<p>If you wonder why you, too, should hate Verified by Visa, read <a href="http://forge.ironrealms.com/2006/09/17/billing-stupidity/">this post</a>.</p>
