  content: Thanks Hans for your insight.  Your comment on using single blade vs. multiple
    blades is interesting.  I haven't had any problems with multiple blades, but my
    head is pretty flat and not really bumpy.  Might be worth testing.

<a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2008/12/07/being-bald">Reports of me regrowing my hair</a> have been greatly exaggerated. Fact is, I went about a week or maybe two and decided I really like being bald, and haven't looked back since.

Not long after I really got the hang of using the <a href="http://headblade.com/">HeadBlade</a>, and shaving every day if I so choose isn't a big deal. I sometimes skip a day or even two, but usually I shave every day.

If you're getting started with the HeadBlade, or thinking about it, here's some tips.

First, prep is important. I get my head wet with hot water when I first step into the shower, and keep it wet with an occasional splash while I do the whole washing thing. Then I lather up some shaving soap (rubbing it right on my pate) until it's good and slick.

Using the HeadBlade is basically like they say in <a href="http://headblade.com/headblade-101.html">HeadBlade 101</a>. I would just mention that if you have been shaving your face with a safety razor or a straight razor, "no pressure" is actually an overstatement. You need some pressure on the front—just enough to keep contact with the skin, no more—otherwise you don't shave anything. Compared to how most guys shave, this really does feel like "no pressure." If at any time you get razor burn or uncomfortable chafing, you probably used too much pressure. If you go over and over your head and nothing happens, you used too little.

The real key to the HeadBlade is not using the blades they sell for it. Because of the way the HeadBlade works, which is very similar to properly using a safety razor (it's all about angle), the more blades you have the worse shave you get. Your head is bumpy, and to fit the curves you need a VW bug not a Cadillac. More blades will just make the shave rougher and less close. It's also important to steer clear of those rubber things they put on most fancy cartridge blades because they act like brakes forcing you to use more pressure on the front.

They don't make cartridges with just one blade, that I have been able to find, so you'll have to use two blades. Fortunately the ones that work best are also the cheapest. There are two options: the Atra blades and the Sensor blades (not Sensor Excel). The Atra are cheaper (especially the knock-offs, like the Personna, which works fabulously) but they tend to clog easier (the back isn't open) and the blades don't flex like the Sensor blades do. But they work much better than the fancy rubber bumper triple blade cartridges. I've had good luck with the Sensor blades but my sensor adaptor broke and I have to order a new one, and the Personna Atra-compatible blades are so cheap I had to see how they worked. They give me an excellent close shave with little effort, just like the Sensor blades, and they're cheaper.

So if you found the HeadBlade lacking, try another blade. Any Atra or Sensor compatible blade works (with the adaptors included in the HeadBlade package), and if you have a favorite for your face try it in the HeadBlade, but do try one with only 2 blades and no rubber bumper because I think you'll be amazed.
