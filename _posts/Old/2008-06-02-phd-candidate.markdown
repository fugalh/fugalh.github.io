<p>A couple weeks back I finished my PhD comprehensive examination, which means I am officially a "PhD Candidate".</p>

<p>The comprehensive exam is a literature survey paper in my area of research and an oral presentation of that survey. You're welcome to read/peruse both at <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/comps">http://hans.fugal.net/comps</a>.</p>
