<p>Erin and I saw <em>Bewitched</em> the other night, and we liked it. My critical review
of the movie can be boiled down to one statement:</p>

<p>Nicole Kidman is not Meg Ryan.</p>

<p>Not exactly rocket science, I know, but this observation takes on more depth
when you realize that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001188/">Norma Ephron</a> also
wrote, directed, and/or produced <em>You've Got Mail</em> and <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>.</p>
