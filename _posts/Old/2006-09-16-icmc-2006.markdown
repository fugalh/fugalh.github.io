<p>My <acronym title='Graduate Assistance in Areas of National
Need'>GAANN</acronym> fellowship will be sending me to New Orleans in November
for the <a href="http://icmc2006.org/">International Computer Music Conference</a> (ICMC). I'm pretty psyched
about this. I've never been to an academic conference, and I've certainly never
been to a conference about Computer Music. It's going to be a blast, and it's
going to be very informative. Hopefully I'll be able to network with some
people in the field working on research similar to my own (which will begin in
earnest in January, since my coursework is (almost) done after this semester).
There will be Computer Music conferences, and I'll be sure to catch some good
old New Orleans Jazz too.</p>

<p>I haven't asked yet, but I'm hoping GAANN will send me to the Linux Audio
Conference in Berlin next year, too.</p>
