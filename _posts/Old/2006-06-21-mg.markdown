    <p>Hey Hans,</p>

    <p>I too bought a nifty scale and am tracking my progress everyday.  You should join us on LardWars.com, a cool little site that subjects you to public humiliation if you don't meet your goals.  I'm on fun.lardwars.com, and (as you can see) I need a little competiotion to keep me motivated  --being at risk of premature death is not enough.</p>

    <p>Let Herlo know if you want in.</p>

<p>My body is going on a diet (not me, but that's another post), but we all know
it's no fun to go on a diet unless you get a nifty digital scale and make cool
graphs of your progress. Over on the left you'll see my cool graph which I
generate with a small ruby script (less than 60 LOC) and even smaller shell
script. The use case is simple. Every day after weighing myself I do simply
this:</p>

<pre><code>mg $my_weight_today
</code></pre>

<p>You too can make cool graphs if you mosey on over to <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src">my src page</a>.</p>
