<p>I've extolled the virtues of <a href="http://developer.kde.org/language-bindings/ruby/index.html">QtRuby</a> before. As GUI toolkits go, Qt is the best (IMHO) and as languages go Ruby is tops (again, IMHO), so naturally QtRuby has potential. QtRuby's biggest stumbling block in the past has been installation. Easy on Linux, but deep voodoo on OS X and perhaps even worse in Windows. That has finally changed.</p>

<p>qt4-qtruby now uses a cmake-based build system. I installed Qt4 from source on my MacBook, then followed the instructions to install qt4-qtruby and gave it a spin. Everything worked perfectly out of the box. </p>

<p>I can't speak for Windows, but QtRuby on Linux and OS X is now practical. (It has been since June or perhaps earlier, but I just got around to trying it out.) Celebrate!</p>
