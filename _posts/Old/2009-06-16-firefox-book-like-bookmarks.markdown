Can anyone point me to a trick or extension that makes bookmarks more like, um, bookmarks? You know, in the real world, when you're reading a book and you decide to stop reading so you can go get a drink of water or go to bed or something, you put in a bookmark. That bookmark is only good until the next time you readâ€”then you'll put the bookmark in a different place. Web "bookmarks" are more like gluing tongue depressors to the book to help you find the book later.

Use case: you're reading a web comic, or an online book, or some other serial content that takes days or months to go through. You want a very simple way to update the bookmark whenever you stop. Ideally, it would be automatic.
