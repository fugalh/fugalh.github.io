<p>As a bread fanatic, I've often dreamed of having my own brick oven. At first I thought it was a complicated and expensive endeavor, and that I couldn't build one because I'm renting. But then I got creative and designed a couple <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/brick/">Brick Ovens for the Cheapskate</a>, and I think that I can build a great oven for about $65, which is portable enough to appease the landlord. </p>
