<p>Well, I did it. You probably already knew that because I've been in the process for some time and I've told just about everyone on the planet. I've written up <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/brick/building_anasazi.html">the things I learned while building my oven</a>, so you can see just what all it takes.</p>

<p>Does it work? Yes, indeed it does. I can make pizza and follow up with a batch of bread. But it's a bit more tricky than the ordinary large brick oven. In a large brick oven, you have lots of room and lots of oxygen for a roarin' fire.  You don't need a lot of fire-tending skill to successfully fire a big oven. But this oven requires quite a bit more skill. I'm going to write up exactly what I've learned about firing a small oven Real Soon Now™, but in the meantime I'll just tell you the secret: small pieces, lots of oxygen, and start at least ⅓ of the way back in the oven. </p>

<p>If you just can't wait, may I recommend visiting the excellent <a href="http://www.woodheat.org/">woodheat.org</a> site which has excellent information on building fires, especially the <a href="http://www.woodheat.org/tips/hiperwoodburning.htm">Concise Guide to High-Performance Woodburning</a> and <a href="http://www.woodheat.org/tips/topdown.htm">Top Down Fever</a>.</p>
