  content: <p>That's why I do skiing, it's easy to justify the time, and the expense
    is taken care of when you teach it and have a free pass :) The only logistical
    obstacle left is driving to the snow, which is not so bad for me, but probably
    much more an issue in Las Cruces.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/articles/2006/07/03/shangri-la">blogged about the Shangri La
"diet"</a>. I suppose I
owe it to all 4 of my readers to summarize my experience. So here's the
summary: it worked and I have no idea if it was placebo effect.</p>

<p>Look at this graph:</p>

<p><img alt="mass times gravity" src="http://hans.fugal.net/images/mg1.png" width="400"/></p>

<p>The period between about 6/5 and 8/2 is when I was following the procedure,
with about 80% fidelity. I lost 10 pounds in short order. I was less hungry. My
wife got mad because I ate less than her almost all the time. </p>

<p>Then I got lazy and stopped taking my swigs. You do get used to swigging olive
oil, but it's never actually <em>fun</em>. The second time around I saw the same
results as before, but I was even less faithful. If I ever got organized enough
to do it 100% I might lose even more weight. </p>

<p>I noticed that even after stopping I naturally ate less for quite some time. I
still eat less than I used to, though not as much less as last August and
September.</p>

<p>Now, was it the placebo effect? No clue. But if it is, is there anything so
wrong with harmlessly tricking your body and mind into eating more healthily?
Is it a failure? No, I think it was a success for me. I just didn't give it
enough priority to continue in the face of vacations and so on. Would I go back
to it? Sure, I'd rather drink a little olive oil between meals than do almost
any other diet. </p>

<p>But really it was mostly an experiment. I know as well as you that just losing
weight is almost absurd. Being fit is more important than how much I weigh, and
I'm terrible at being fit. So that's where I need to focus my efforts.</p>

<p>Being honest with myself, here are the obstacles to being fit, in decreasing
order: time, effort, and a love of swimming. </p>

<p>Time is one of the things I most
treasure. Giving up 200-300 perfectly good hours a year to some mindless
excercise is frankly apalling. I need to convince myself that it would be worth
it, or make it something I want to do. </p>

<p>It takes effort to get up and excercise, and I
won't deny that it's easier to sit there programming or researching. My mind is
already in shape and it's much easier to work my mind than my body. </p>

<p>Now love of swimming might seem like a silly factor, but it's at least
partially true. I love to swim, and I hate to run/walk/etc. If I'm going to
excercise you better believe I'm going to be swimming, not running/walking/etc.
But getting to the pool is more than just effort, it's logistics. Money, car,
parking, being all wet, chlorine... It's not an insurmountable obstacle, it
will just take some planning. </p>

<p>I mention all that because soon you will see a post about how my new swimming
habit is going. I got a book that promises to make lap swimming enjoyable, and
from what I've read I believe them. The pool is closed this week but I've got
all the plane laid out on how to adjust my routine, and next wednesday I'll
start my new life. I'll reset my graph in the sidebar and we'll see how
swimming compares to swigging olive oil.</p>
