<p>Leonard paniq Ritter sent me a nifty patch for
<a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/hearnet">hearnet</a> some time ago. I really dig it,
and I finally got around to incorporating the patch and releasing a new
version. Here's what paniq has to say about it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>changed code so that it uses 32-voice polyphony and plays bridges /
    chromatic orders.</p>

    <p>as an effect, you get very harmonic sounds if packet sizes on a
    site are the same, and quite weird stuff if packet sizes vary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/hearnet/hearnet-0.0.4.tar.gz">Go get it</a> and see how
much cooler it sounds!</p>
