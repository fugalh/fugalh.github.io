<p>All I knew about SNMP was that
SNMP could tell you stuff about your network.  That sounded like a cool thing,
but every time I had tried to grok SNMP on the web, I had learned that the
Simple Network Management Protocol is not <em>Simple</em> at all.</p>

<p>Then the auditor told us that SNMP was a security risk to our network, rattling
of strange jibberish like "community strings," "public/private," and "mibs." So
I curled up with <em>Essential SNMP</em> over a weekend and promptly became
competent.  This book will get you up to speed in SNMP in a jiffy. It is
exactly what it claims to be&mdash;the essentials of SNMP. Those essentials are
probably everything you need to know to start making SNMP work for you in your
network.</p>

<p>This book is a little aged; it was published in 2001. (I'm writing this in
mid-2005) Luckily, SNMP hasn't changed much since then. Most devices you will
find in your existing network probably don't even support SNMPv3, and some
probably only support SNMPv1. The book does explain all three versions well. </p>

<p>SNMP may not have changed much, but the tools have changed slightly. For
example, none of the <a href="http://net-snmp.sf.net/">Net-SNMP</a> examples will work with recent releases.
However, the idea of what you can do is still important, and translating from
the book's examples to current syntax is simple enough once you learn what has
changed in syntax since 2001. (Hint: <acronym title="Read the fine
manual">RTFM</acronym>) There is a chapter on <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/">MRTG</a>, which is useful, but if
it were written today they might have chosen <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a> instead. I can only hope
that OpenView has become more administrator-friendly since this book was
written.</p>

<h4>Book Organization</h4>

<p>Chapters 1-3 cover the basics of SNMP. They are by far the most valuable
chapters. By the time you finish them you should understand what SNMP is good
for, what it can do for you, and why you need to be careful with SNMP devices
on your network. Graciously, O'Reilly has put <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/esnmp/chapter/ch02.html">chapter
2</a>&mdash;the meatiest
chapter of this trio&mdash;online for all to read.</p>

<p>The remainder of the chapters go into great detail on how to configure your
<acronym title="network management station">NMS</acronym>es, agents, and
everything else SNMP. The spotlighted NMSes are <a href="http://net-snmp.sf.net/">Net-SNMP</a>, HP
OpenView, and Castle Rock's SNMPc. Many other SNMP softwares are covered
lightly in appropriate places. More importantly, I think, is that the nooks and
crannies of SNMP itself are explored. You can learn how to grok MIBs, build
your own MIBs and how to write your own agents or NMSes in Perl (with a
spattering of examples). That chapter on <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/">MRTG</a> also lies in this section.</p>

<p>The appendices cover various topics in more detail and provide a nice reference
for things like which RFCs to read for more information.</p>

<p>You will consume this book quickly, because you will skim over much of the
details in the latter portion of the book. Especially if you can't afford
OpenView. When you're done, you'll go on a network management rampage, not
resting until you've set up all the cool SNMP stuff you can find, e.g.
<a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a>, <a href="http://net-snmp.sf.net/">Net-SNMP</a>, and whatever cool commercial NMS trial versions you
can get your hands on. And you'll have fun doing it.</p>
