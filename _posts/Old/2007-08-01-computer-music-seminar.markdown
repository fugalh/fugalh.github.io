<p>Today I presented a 1-hour seminar on Computer Music to a summer camp group
here at New Mexico State University. We talked about what we can do with
computers, demonstrated <a href="http://ardour.org/">Ardour</a>,
<a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>, and GarageBand, and had a good
listen to a few quality pieces. We even mentioned U2.</p>

<p>My presentation is <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/Computer_Music_Seminar.pdf">available as a
PDF</a>, and it has links to all
the interesting sites we mentioned. For those that weren't there, I'd like to
point out especially <a href="http://realworldremixed.com/">Real World Remixed</a> where
you can download sample packs for some great music, including Peter Gabriel and
Afro Celt Sound System songs, and remix them yourself with something like
Ardour.  Hours of fun!</p>
