    it hangs a bit more easily.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was on a quest to get Ogg Vorbis working on a Mac. I tried <a href="http://qtcomponents.sourceforge.net/">the QuickTime Components project</a> and it worked for awhile. Then it broke with QuickTime 7. Truth be known, it never worked all that great before, though it did decode the music. Then I found <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> and never looked back.</p>

<p>Today I learned that somewhere in the interim <a href="http://xiph.org/">Xiph.org</a> filled the gap. Now you can download <a href="http://xiph.org/quicktime/">XiphQT</a>, stick <code>XiphQT.component</code> in <code>/Library/Components</code>, and you're off and running. This is precisely how the issue should have been addressed in the first place, and I'm glad it finally was, whenever it was. I'm also happy to have been ignorant of the fact for so long, since I despise iTunes for other reasons, and this tells me I've lived without regular iTunes abuse for a long hapy time.</p>
