<p>Announcing the latest version of <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/hearnet">hearnet</a>:
the (in)famous little <a href="http://jackaudio.org">JACK</a> toy. The name may bring back
memories of your favorite lunch lady, but the sound of your own network traffic
will move you in ways that she never could have hoped to move you. I hope
that's a good thing.</p>

<p>This release sports filter expressions (a la tcpdump) and the ability to drop
privileges and run as a normal user, and therefore play nice with the other
JACK apps in your playground.</p>

<p>Enjoy, and don't get any hair in your network.</p>
