<p>iTunes does not support <a href="http://vorbis.com/">OGG Vorbis</a>, which makes me sad.
The <a href="http://qtcomponents.sf.net/">qtcomponents</a> project used to fill that gap, back in
the Panther/Quicktime 6 days, but that project has not done a thing to get it
working in Tiger (more accurately, Quicktime 7). More on that in a later post,
probably.</p>

<p>So what is an OGG-lover to do? I looked for native OS X OGG players, I really
did. All the links were broken, and the promising players were broken or
maliciously murdered (e.g. Mint Audio) by their authors.  Audion 3 turned out
to be the only one that could play OGG, but it has serious stability problems,
is EOL, is not libre, and is crippleware to boot. No thanks.</p>

<p>Once upon a time (just after getting Tiger and finding the qtcomponents OGG
compenent was broken), I tried XMMS (via
<a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a>), but XMMS didn't play. Lot of
good that did. Today I decided to try again, to see if it had been fixed. Sure
enough, XMMS will play (with the ESD output plugin) and happily handles OGG
files. Why, I might even be able to use
<a href="http://www.luminal.org/wiki/index.php/IMMS/IMMS">IMMS</a>! (But this much optimism
should be discouraged.)</p>
