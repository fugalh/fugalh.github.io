<p>Sipura SPAs are excellent phones and ATAs. Some (if not all) of these use an XML provisioning file, which is nice and transparent. But it's a pain to type. To that end, Sipura has a tool called <acronym title="Sipura Profile Compiler">SPC</acronym> which translates a simpler text format into the XML required by the phones. The only problem is that it's a royal pain to get your hands on.</p>

<p>So I reverse-engineered it (or perhaps you would say "forward-engineered") from the docs and samples, in 50 lines of Ruby code. You can find it <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/spc">here</a>.</p>
