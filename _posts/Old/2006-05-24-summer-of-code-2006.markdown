  content: <p>Congrats!  Sounds like a fun project, at least as long as the Ardour
    source code isn't too bad to work with. Happy hacking!</p>

  content: '<p>Actually, the Ardour code is a shining star of beauty and glory. I
    was floored when I first dug into it at how clean and well-organized it is. Especially
    in contrast to the most recent large project codebases I had inspected: Asterisk
    and SER.</p>'

<p>It's official! I am one of the recipients of Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> grant.
That means I get paid $4500 to improve <a href="http://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> according
to my proposal over the summer. Combined with the GAANN fellowship I've
received this means I can spend most of the time this summer writing code for
Ardour and studying for quals.</p>

<p>My proposal was to modify Ardour so that plugins can be applied to regions
instead of just tracks, both for realtime processing and bounced to disk. This
is a feature I have sorely missed in Ardour, as it is an important tool for
making electronic music and musique concrete efficiently. The other half is to
add undo/redo serialization of the current undo system to allow unlimited undo
across program instances.</p>

<p>I'm really excited for this opportunity. It will be my first serious
involvement with a big and important open source project as a developer. I've
often told myself I needed to get involved with one, and now I have an ideal
opportunity to do just that.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://ardour.org/node/237">two other SoC recipients for Ardour</a>. One is adding basic MIDI recording and playback, and the other is doing a Windows port. </p>
