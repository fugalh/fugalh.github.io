<p>The migration to <a href="http://typosphere.org">Typo</a> is progressing. With apologies to Stuart for the accidental planet flood, which was due to my trying to get blosxom to give me all of my posts in one rss feed for importing, things should be smooth sailing from here out.</p>

<p>Obviously (unless you're reading this by feed), I still need to port my theme over. That will come with time. For now, I'll be a full-blown Web 2.0 lackie complete with default Typo theme. It's a nice theme but I'm sick of seeing it on every other blog I come across.</p>

<p>I did manage to set up routes for the old blosxom permalinks, so google should still be able to find me. I'll leave blosxom in place for those old yodl permalinks, as well.</p>
