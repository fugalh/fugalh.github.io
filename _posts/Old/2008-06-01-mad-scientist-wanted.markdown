<p>If any of you out there into whose RSS feeds my blog has infiltrated have some way to measure pH, I call upon you to perform an experiment and report back for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>Measure the pH of 1 cup milk. I reckon it would be about 6.5. Then, add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda, stir well, give it a minute, and measure the pH. Repeat until you have added a total of 2 teaspoons of baking soda. You will get a warm fuzzy feeling for helping.</p>
