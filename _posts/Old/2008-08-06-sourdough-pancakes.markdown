  content: I am going to hypothesize that it is probably the soda that makes the difference.   I
    have been trying hard to make the kind of sourdough pancakes that my Aunt Mary
    used to make, and yes, they did have a somewhat rubbery texture which I feel carries
    the sourdough flavor better.   When I make sourdough pancakes with the soda they
    come out as an inferior version of the great pancakes that I make with buttermilk.  They
    are grainy and a little tough rather than light and fluffy and tender and I hate
    that.   So next time I am going to use your family recipe instead and leave out
    the soda.   I bet if I cook them on my nice hot griddle that they will brown nicely
    and still have that rubbery texture and flavor that I am looking for.  Aunt Mary's
    pancakes were golden brown and delicious.    When I was a kid I would walk over
    and have breakfast with her just to enjoy those cakes.

<p>My family is really into sourdough biscuits and sourdough pancakes. But to be honest, the recipes they use are a bit peculiar. You've probably never seen pancakes or biscuits like these, but you end up loving them anyway. I'm going to talk about the pancakes here and ignore the biscuits which are generally regarded to be the epitome of perfection by all who consume them.</p>

<p>Here's the recipe they use for sourdough pancakes:</p>

<p><img alt="leaf 1" src="http://hans.fugal.net/sourdough/sourdough4.jpg" width="200" /><img alt="leaf 2" src="http://hans.fugal.net/sourdough/sourdough5.jpg" width="200" /></p>

<p>Note that last bit: "approximately 80 small pancakes.â€¦ Remember that sourdough pancakes have a very firm texture, and are entirely different from the pancakes you are used to." They're small, white, rubbery, sour, and delicious. But you see, I'm really only interested in the sour and delicious parts. I have no investment in them being small, white, and rubbery.</p>

<p>So when <a href="http://www.joepastry.com/">Joe Pastry</a> (a food blogger I have immense respect for) started talking about <a href="http://joepastry.web.aplus.net/index.php?title=living_the_sourdough_life&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">sourdough pancakes</a>, and showed pictures of normal brown pancakes that I'm sure were sour, delicious, and not rubbery, I had to try it out.</p>

<p>And so I did, this morning. I followed his recipe, except I halved it (yes, I halved an egg) and made it with whole wheat flour (as he discusses at the end of the post). The pancakes were excellent. All the requisite sourdough taste and deliciousness, and normal pancake size/color/texture. Plus it was a lot of fun to watch the batter foam up when I added the soda water. </p>

<p>So if you make small white rubbery sourdough pancakes (that means you, family), give his recipe a try and see if you don't like it even better.</p>

<p>Then I recommend you read the <a href="http://joepastry.web.aplus.net/index.php?title=can_you_really_make_pancakes_out_of_star&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">follow-up post</a> on the science behind sourdough pancakes. And for extra credit, compare the two recipes and hypothesize on why the results are so different.</p>
