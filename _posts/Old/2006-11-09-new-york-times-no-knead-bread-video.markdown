    <p>Grr, stupid newspaper sites. My links have stopped working. One asks you to login with your free as in Big Brother username and password, and the other is just dead. So let's try this again. Follow this link: </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html?_r=1&amp;amp;adxnnl=1&amp;amp;oref=login&amp;amp;adxnnlx=1163219345-c1Tgu6kNIWBQMzngvuJ/xA&amp;amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;adxnnlx=1163219345-c1Tgu6kNIWBQMzngvuJ/xA&amp;pagewanted=all</a> and if big brother asks you for your username and password (and you haven't already succombed) you might find that username bitemebiteme4 and password biteme work. Or you might find another username/password pair at <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.nytimes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.nytimes.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you learn to make bread, Big Brother can never take it away from you.</p>

<p>The New York Times website has a nifty <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/ifr_main.jsp?nsid=a-37e9baf5:10ed06a2f33:-7bea&amp;fr_story=35eac03d90314ffed6a0c0ae143ab87b1474fb89&amp;st=1163137872967&amp;mp=FLV&amp;cpf=false&amp;fvn=8&amp;fr=111006_125112_w37e9baf5x10ed06a2f33xw7be9&amp;rdm=649847.3925457326">short
video</a>
 (and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1">accompanying article</a>) that shows you how to make no-knead bread. It's so simple, a six year old could
do it. It's not quite the way I tend to make bread, but I know the no-knead bit
works and works well, so do yourself a favor and give this a try. It couldn't
be easier. I guarantee it will taste deeeelicous.</p>

<p>I'm serious. Try it. This weekend. Go ahead. I'm watching you.</p>
