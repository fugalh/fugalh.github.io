<p>If you must shave, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6886845/">this is the way to do it</a>. My old shaving brush (which boar bristle) was looking pretty sorry and felt even worse, so I got a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2asu6f">badger-hair</a> <a href="http://www.amazingshaving.com/page/amsh/PROD/shb/cc1000">brush</a> (which is supposed to be much better than boar bristle). In the same order I got a <a href="http://www.amazingshaving.com/page/amsh/PROD/sar/cc180">double-edged (aka safety) razor</a> and a round of <a href="http://www.amazingshaving.com/page/amsh/PROD/soa/cc143">bay rum soap</a>. I balked at the expensive shaving stands, but not wanting my new gear to suffer the same fate my old brush did, I knew I needed one. So I planned on making my own. The internet is good to the DIY-inclined, like myself, and provided me all the information I needed to make one of two styles: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Razor-and-Shaving-Brush-Stand/">the coat-hanger stand</a> and <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-%245-PVC-Shaving-Stand/">the PVC stand</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/F8N/9FVP/FBHXD0GM/F8N9FVPFBHXD0GM.MEDIUM.jpg" alt="coat-hanger stand"/> <img src="http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FCH/UBOL/TVUEP27W80A/FCHUBOLTVUEP27W80A.MEDIUM.jpg" alt="PVC stand"/></p>

<p>Today I whipped up a stand out of a coat hanger, but it differs from the Instructables version in several ways. First of all, I wanted to save space and integrate my mug into the stand, so the over-the-center bit had to change. Second, I wasn't nearly as fastidious in my coat hanger bending technique, so mine isn't nearly as pretty. Third, I don't have anything that can cut coat hanger and so I just used the whole thing. Luckily, I had a hanger with less metal lying aroundâ€”the kind with a cardboard tube for the pants (like you get from the dry cleaners). It worked out to be about perfect in length.</p>

<p>So, I got out my pliers, straightened the hangar, started bending, and a few minutes and several rebendings later I had this:</p>

<p>It's working better than I anticipated. I didn't doubt a quality stand could be achieved with coat hanger, but I did doubt my haphazard free-form bending would produce one. Amazing stuff, coat hanger.</p>

<p>As for the actual shaving, give me a couple of days or weeks and I'll post my experience with the badger brush and DE razor. If you're interested in wet shaving, the article linked above is a good start, as is <a href="http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2006/07/10/a-guide-to-the-gourmet-shaving-experience/">this article</a> and this excellent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mantic59">series of videos on YouTube</a>. If you only watch one video, and only get a brush and soap or cream (and skip the safety razor bit), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCTzhFFRihA">this video</a> will serve you well.</p>
