    <p>Great pointers!</p>

    <p>One thing though, you don't need that symlink in the last step... just be sure to include mod_alias in lighttpd and then just do:</p>

    <p><code>alias.url = ( "/typo" => "/srv/www/typo/public" )</code></p>

    <p>Actually Tim, it should be:</p>

    <p>alias.url = ( "/typo/" => "/srv/www/typo/public/" )</p>

<p>I am in the process of migrating my blog to <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">Typo</a>. Blosxom has served me well, but I think it's time I joined the ranks of cool blogs and allowed people to comment, trackback, etc. Blosxom can do all that, but it's not very much fun. </p>

<p>Blosxom's strength is its simplicity. When I wanted a simple blog, it was perfect.</p>

<p>Now, getting typo to work was not a walk in the park. I'll walk you through what I had to do.</p>

<p>First, you have to get typo and install it. I hear rumors that version 4 release is imminent, so I grabbed the svn version. Next, make a database and set up config/database.yml. Now you can run <code>script/server -e production</code> and point your browser at http://localhost:3000/ and give it a whirl.</p>

<p>I tried the RSS and atom converters in <code>db/converters</code> but I wasn't satisfied with the results. So I wrote a blosxom converter, which I will contribute. If you can't find it feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>The hard part was getting typo to run under a subdirectory in my mixed apache/lighttpd setup. All fugal.net sites are running through Apache. My rails apps run through lighttpd, with apache's mod_proxy.  So, you have to configure apache, lighttpd, and rails each in turn.</p>

<h3>Apache Configuration</h3>

<pre><code>    ProxyPass               /typo http://127.0.0.1:81/typo
    ProxyPassReverse        /typo http://127.0.0.1:81/typo
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Lighttpd Configuration</h3>

<p>The normal lighttpd stuff, and then:
<code><pre>
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/typo(/|$)" {
    server.indexfiles = ("dispatch.fcgi")
    server.document-root = "/srv/www/typo/public/"
    server.error-handler-404 = "/dispatch.fcgi"
    server.errorlog = "/srv/www/typo/log/error.log"
    accesslog.filename = "/srv/www/typo/log/access.log"
    fastcgi.server = ( ".fcgi" => (
        "typo" => ( "min-procs" => 1, "max-procs" => 1,
            "socket" => "/tmp/typo.fcgi.socket",
            "bin-path" => "/srv/www/typo/public/dispatch.fcgi",
            "bin-environment" => ( "RAILS_ENV" => "production" ),
            "idle-timeout" => 120
            )
        )
    )
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>You don't need <code>strip-request-uri</code>, because we'll take care of the <code>typo/</code> prefix in rails.</p>

<h3>Rails Config</h3>

<p>Add this to <code>config/environment.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    ActionController::AbstractRequest.relative_url_root = "/typo"
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, and this was the real stink, you have to help lighttpd find files in <code>public/</code>. Lighttpd gets a request for http://hans.fugal.net/typo/foo.html which is a static file in <code>public/</code>, and so it looks in the document root to find <code>/typo/foo.html</code>, which means it looks for <code>/srv/www/typo/public/typo/foo.html</code>, which doesn't exist. This is easy to fix:</p>

<pre><code>    cd /srv/www/typo/public
    ln -s . typo
</code></pre>

<p>et voil&aacute;! You should be up and running.</p>
