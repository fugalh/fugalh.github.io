    depends on whether you're interested in what the papers have to say, though.</p>

<p>In case you were itching for a little insight into what a grad student like me does, here's the stack of papers I need to read or reread, and summarize in a literature survey by Christmas (This is the department's "Comprehensive Examination"):</p>

<p><img src="http://hans.fugal.net/images/comp-papers.jpg" alt="Comprehensive Examination Reading List"/></p>

<p>Almost every paper in there is 2-up double sided, i.e. 4 pages of literature for each piece of paper. Oh, and I didn't print out the two PhD dissertations that were about 250 pages each. I've read roughly half of this already, but I need to revisit everything in the process of writing the survey. </p>

<p>Now you know what I'll be doing for the next couple months.</p>
