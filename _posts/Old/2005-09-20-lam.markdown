<p><a href="http://lam.fugal.net/"><acronym title="Music Made with
Linux">LAM</acronym></a> is a site that aggregates music made with linux and
spits it back out at you in the form of HTML, RSS (podcast), and M3U. I wrote
it as an excercise in learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> while
reading the Pragmatic Programmers' excellent (as always) book <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web
Development with Rails: A Pragmatic
Guide</a>.</p>

<p>It was, and is, a lot of fun. More fun than I've had doing web-stuff in a very
long time. But the real reason for this post is so that it will be linked from
somewhere so Google will eventually pick it up and return it on a search for
"linux audio music" or "music made with linux".</p>
