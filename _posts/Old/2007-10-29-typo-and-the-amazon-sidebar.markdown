<p>I finally got the typo amazon sidebar working. Nifty thumbnails and riches beyond measure are now mine! Well, at least the thumbnails…</p>

<p>This is what you need to do. Enable the Amazon postprocessor in your preferred text filter (e.g. Markdown), which lets you write urls as <code>&lt;a href="amazon:0743253434"&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;</code>. (Note: I find that if you don't use double quotes it doesn't work) Then, set up the Amazon sidebar, which is straightforward. Handcrafted URLs don't seem to work, though it's possible a handcrafted URL of the kind generated by the Amazon filter would (e.g. <code>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743253434/thefug-20</code>).</p>
