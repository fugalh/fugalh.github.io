    <p>I've been using Dvorak fulltime for about 8 years now, for programming, and a little sys-admin, and have never looked back.</p>

    <p>Typing is smoother, your fingers move less, and you're forced to touch-type properly as you can't see the keys.  It takes a couple of weeks of hard work, then it's all gravy!</p>

    <p>Check out <a href="http://dvzine.org/" rel="nofollow">http://dvzine.org/</a> for a cute Dvorak comic.</p>

<p>Steve Yegge has posted an funny, irreverent, and above all excellent <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-         dirtiest-little-secret.html">argument   for touch typing</a>. I highly recommend it even if you do touch type.</p>

<p>I am downright flabbergasted by some of the comments though. There are hunt-and-peck folks defending their inability to touch type as lifestyle choice based    on the belief that they will get RSI. People justifying typing slow because it
 saves them from wasting time chatting or writing long emails. There are some    interesting claims from 2–4 finger typists that they can type without looking   at 70wpm (this is certainly possible), and choosing not to learn to touch type
 the "right way" because it will give them RSI (this is certainly ludicrous).</p>

<p>Typing is a vital skill if you work in IT, especially programming. Of this       there is no doubt, rationalizing strangers aside. I simply cannot imagine       being stuck typing at 10wpm or less. It would be like being stuck behind a      pair of tractors on the freeway going 20 mph. For the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Last I checked I type about 65 wpm on average. I could probably go faster, but   I never have felt the need. I can type as fast as I think when programming. If
 I were a stream-of-consciousness novelist or a secretary, I could probably      make use of a faster typing speed. As it is, 60–70wpm seems to be a sweet spot
 for me.</p>

<p>I'd like to discuss the ridiculous RSI claims. Yes, if you type all day without  breaks you can get RSI. There are certain things you can do to mitigate or      exacerbate this for a given amount of typing and typing speed. If you tried to  go lightning fast all the time you might hasten the onset of RSI. But I argue   that the absolute worst thing you can do if you're afraid of RSI is to not      touch type. RSI means Repetitive Stress Injury, from repetitively performing    certain motions until your body starts to break down. Smaller more relaxed      motions are less stressful on your body than large stiff motions. If you touch
 type well, your hands are relaxed, your fingers float over the keys, and        movement is minimal. Of course you still need to take care—take breaks, spend   some time thinking without typing or drawing pictures on paper, proper          nutrition, etc. But the biggest thing you can do to prevent RSI is to have      proper form. And maybe learn dvorak (I still use qwerty because I find          sysadmin and programming to be tedious with dvorak, but I don't spend most of   my time actually typing).</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you hunt and peck 24/7 guess how much <em>more</em>               movement—repetitive movement—your body is enduring? Ever heard of tennis        elbow? RSI isn't the exclusive privilege of touch typists. If you type slow     enough that you can't possible get RSI, you are irrelevant. If you type fast    enough to be productive but don't have good form, you are setting yourself up   for RSI. If you're RSI-prone or just paranoid, go learn dvorak now or find a    job that doesn't require much typing.</p>

<p>I'd add to Steve's exhortation to learn to touch type, that if you do touch      type but you feel your form is off, you have low accuracy, or you feel that     your fingers are stiff, do some conscientious practice. Focus on accuracy and   relaxation first, then speed. Enhancing your typing skills is a great benefit   if you spend a lot of time typing, although learning to touch type in the       first place is obviously a much bigger payoff.</p>

<p>Let's continue to learn from musicians: correct form (including relaxed posture  and <em>keep those wrists off the keyboard/desk</em>), accuracy, then speed.</p>
