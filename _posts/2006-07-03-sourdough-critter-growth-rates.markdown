  content: <p>It definitely is for gluten development, but I think it imparts flavor
    as well. Or rather, being dough (flour + water) for a longer period imparts more
    flavor, and autolyse meets that condition.</p>

  content: "1. I read your nice differently. The starter becomes most sour at temperatures
    where bacteria grow fastest RELATIVE to yeast. A higher growth rate for one organism
    just means that growth and consumption take less time. Therefore having more bacteria
    at the end of one fermentation also means having fewer yeast cells. It seems to
    me from the data that the lactobacilli always take over (b/c of faster growth
    relative to yeast) except at the temperatures 22–24 °C, where yeast and bacilli
    grow at the same rate.\r\n2. Flavor results from volatile compounds created during
    fermentation (by microorganisms as well as enzymes already contained in the flour)
    and baking. Acetic acid, which allegedly develops more readily in cooler conditions,
    is also volatile (unlike lactic acid) and affects flavor."

<p>Fellow sourdough freaks, I give you a graph of the growth rate of the two
primary sourdough critters, Lactobacillus sanfransiscensis (the sourdough
bacteria) and Candida milleri (the wild yeast), by temparature (Celsius), as
described <a href="http://www.nyx.net/~dgreenw/whatistherelationshipbetwe.html">in the sourdough
FAQ</a> and I believe
also in <a href="http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/7/2616">this paper by Gänzl et
al</a>. There are graphs in the
paper, but they're not superimposed. My imagination is imperfect so I made
graphs based on the curve equation given.</p>

<p><img alt="Growth rate of L. sanfranciscensis and C. milleri" src="http://hans.fugal.net/images/sourdough_time_temp.png" width="450px"/></p>

<p>The take-home lesson is that the bacteria grow faster than the yeast at higher
temperature, so if you want more sour proof at a higher temperature. Rumor has
it that "flavor" develops better at cooler temperatures though so you might be
trading "flavor" (whatever that is) for more sour. I think they mean the
elusive bread faeries that seem to visit when you retard your dough in the
fridge or in autolyse or something.</p>
