<p>I had the hardest time convincing things to route properly from my home network
to my work network, over the VPN (racoon&lt;->netscreen25).</p>

<p>Here's what my routing table used to look like:</p>

<pre><code>166.70.37.148/30 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 166.70.37.150
172.17.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.17.0.3
default via 166.70.37.149 dev eth1
default via 172.17.0.3 dev eth0  scope link
</code></pre>

<p>So even though <code>ping 172.16.59.143</code> would go over the VPN, it would have a
source of <code>166.70.37.150</code>. This was unacceptable, and was messing things up
although it kind of half-worked. The following fixed it:</p>

<pre><code># ip route add 172.16.0.0/12 via 166.70.37.149 dev eth1 src 172.17.0.3
# ip route get 172.16.59.143
172.16.59.143 via 166.70.37.149 dev eth1  src 172.17.0.3
    cache  mtu 1500 advmss 1460 metric10 64
</code></pre>
