<p>I hate configuring Nagios. I thought I would get used to it, but I just can't.
(I must admit that Nagios is an improvement over Big Brother, which is what we
used to use at work.)</p>

<p>I don't know how I missed it for so long, but I just stumbled on
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/">mon</a>. mon is easy to configure, well
thought out, modular, and just plain better than Nagios, IMHO. In a couple of
hours time I had mon doing more than I had been able to muster the gumption to
configure nagios to do in the past 2 months. That's perhaps the biggest benefit
of mon over Nagios: mon is fun, Nagios is a chore.</p>
