    <p>How much is cheap?  I've got a Treo 650 that I don't have any need for, but I need to recoup a bit of the cost.</p>

    <p>Cheers,</p>

<p>I'm looking to buy an old palm-based device. By old I mean cheap. If it's new
and cheap, well hey I'll take it.</p>

<p>Requirements: it works, USB connectivity (or bluetooth) and cable or cradle
included, at least 8MB RAM or accepts SD cards, Palm OS 3.0 or greater,
preferably normal batteries (e.g. AAA), and that's it. If you have an old
device lying around gathering dust while you dote on your iPhone or Treo or
whatever, sell it to me and give it a good home.</p>
