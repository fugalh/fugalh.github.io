<p>I have a little <a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org">Camping</a> toy, and I decided to
play a bit with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> to render a few simple
equations. I read <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/">the insructions</a> and played
around with a static file and found that all I needed was to use XHTML and
everything would Just Workâ„¢. </p>

<p>Until I tried to do it in Camping. I'll spare you the boring details and cut to
the chase:</p>

<pre><code>def layout
  @headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/xhtml+xml'
  xhtml_transitional do
    body { self &lt;&lt; yield }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The trick is getting the MIME type right.</p>
