<p>I am writing this blog entry from my iBook G4 with a wireless connection from
Linux, with no external wireless device. That's right, you heard me correctly.</p>

<p><a href="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de">The Broadcom 43xx Linux Driver</a> has made this
possible. See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/162894/">this LWN article</a> for a good
starting place.</p>

<p>I stubbornly compile my own kernel so it wasn't as simple as installing
<code>bcm43xx-modules-2.6.15</code>, but with module-assistant it wasn't hard either. The
only trick was knowing to compile the softmac module and install its headers.
Something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install bcm43xx-source dpatch
m-a -t a-i ieee80211softmac
dpkg -i /usr/src/ieee80211softmac-headers*deb
m-a -t a-i bcm43xx
modprobe ieee80211_crypt_wep
modprobe bcm43xx
ip link set up eth1
iwconfig eth1 channel 1 essid fugal key restricted yourkeyhere
udhcpc -i eth1
</code></pre>

<p>It's still in the not-for-the-weak-of-heart stage, but it seems to work well to
me.</p>
