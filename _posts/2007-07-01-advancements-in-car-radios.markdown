  content: <p>That is good news. I was looking for a stereo with aux input a year,  maybe
    two ago, and the results were pretty depressing. But anyway, I'll let you know
    if I manage to get the broken CD player working. It might not be soon though.
    I've got a whole lot of these decks to fence. Busy, busy, busy.</p>

<p>Last night somebody broke into and/or vandalized cars in our parking lot. My
car was halfway across the parking lot (big church parking lot behind our
apartments) but otherwise unvandalized. I say unvandalized, but not unrobbed.
They took my car radio. It looked like a CD deck, but as they will no doubt
discover the CD deck doesn't work. I hope they enjoy it. I'm glad my car is
easy to break into (did I even lock the doors?), or I might have smashed
windows like the nuns in another apartment did. If the clowns made any big
mistakes it was smashing the windows of a nun car. Hopefully they'll be caught,
but I'm guessing probably not.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll probably replace the radio with something low-end (as this
one was, which might explain the inoperative CD player). When I bought the
solen one, I had to search high and low for one that was cheap, played CDs, had
a knob dial (instead of +/- buttons), and had an auxilary input for my mp3
player. The aux input was the hardest thing to find, so it was a bit of a
trick. </p>

<p>I just browsed <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com">Crutchfield</a> and I'm pleased to see
that just about 90% of the decks (even the low-end ones) have aux input, many
on the front. The only thing I need to watch out for now is not to get
something that only works with iPod, and that knob (most seem to have knobs
these days too). Aux inputs on almost all car stereos; now that's progress.</p>
