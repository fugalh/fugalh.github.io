<p>I have told you about the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/">Hipster
PDA</a>
<a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/articles/2006/10/11/pda">before</a>. Today I found a
wonderful medium for those of us looking for something a little nicer than
index cards and paperclips. It's like the <a href="http://www.moleskines.com/klmb717.html">Moleskine Pocket
Notebook</a> but even smaller (so that it
actually fits in your pocket) and with a faux leather cover instead of the
rather boring Moleskine cardboard. This thing feels like Napa leather. I bought
it for logging my swimming workouts, but I don't know if I can bring myself to
get it all wetâ€”it feels so nice in my hands.</p>

<p>Did I mention it's cheaper than Moleskine? See if you can't find
<a href="http://www.miquelrius.com">Miquelrius</a> products at a bookstore near you.
You're looking for the Flexible Notebook line. They have full- and half-size
notebooks too.</p>
