<p>I released ladspar, a Ruby module for using <a href="http://ladspa.org">LADSPA</a>
plugins. I'm pretty psyched about it, mostly because it will let me write the
textfile-driven software synth I've been dreaming about, but also because it's
so darned cool and only took me a week to write. (of course it helps that Erin
is out of town...)</p>

<p>Every silver lining has its cloud, though, and mine is my example in the README
was seriously flawed. Here's the corrected example (I'm too lazy to repackage
and reupload it):</p>

<pre><code>require 'ladspa'
require 'narray'

# load the CMT library
cmt = LADSPA.load_library('cmt')

# get an instance of the amp_mono plugin
amp_mono = cmt.plugins.find {|p| p.label == 'amp_mono'}.instantiate(44100)

# The ports are Gain, Input, and Output.
amp_mono.ports[0].connect_port(2.0) # gain

input = NArray.sfloat(44100)
amp_mono.ports[1].connect_port(input)

output = NArray.sfloat(44100)
amp_mono.ports[2].connect_port(output)

amp_mono.activate if amp_mono.has_activate

# prep the input data ...

amp_mono.run

amp_mono.deactivate if amp_mono.has_deactivate
amp_mono.cleanup
</code></pre>
