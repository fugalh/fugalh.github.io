    <p>R is an excellent tool and another one which I highly recommend. There is some overlap, but I see the tools as complements—R picks up where gnuplot leaves off. Whenever I need to make histograms or do statistical analysis (vs. graphical analysis) I reach for R.</p>

    <p>I didn't mention it here because I didn't want to steal the spotlight from gnuplot. Also because this is a book review about an awesome gnuplot book and I have yet to come across an awesome R book (though there are a few candidates I haven't got my hands on yet).</p>

<p>One of the oldest and most universally useful tools we have is <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a>. It is also one of the least understood and most             underutilized tools we have. </p>

<p>I can hear you now. "What do I need gnuplot for? I don't make graphs." Well      that's exactly the problem. Everyone who works with data <em>should</em> be making     graphs, and lots of them. Do you write programs that manipulate data? You need  gnuplot. Do you want to evaluate performance or traffic on your website? You    need gnuplot. Do you want to impress your friends with cool graphs of the       <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2006/07/03/sourdough-critter-growth-rates">growth rates of yeast and bacteria in sourdough</a> or <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/images/mg.svg">your weight loss and percent     body fat</a>? You need gnuplot.</p>

<p>I've been using gnuplot for years. I scraped up enough gnuplot skillz to make    basic graphs and it has been invaluable. But I knew gnuplot could do more than  I knew how to make it do, and whenever I tried to do something advanced it was  only with great pain that I succeeded. Often I failed. Let's face it, gnuplot   can be a bear to learn. Why? Well, mostly because of the documentation. Not     that there isn't any, almost the contrary. There's a <em>lot</em> of documentation,    but it's very much reference documentation. What the world has been lacking is  a good introduction to gnuplot that isn't afraid to get nitty-gritty where it   needs to, but doesn't just parrot the abundant but obscure documentation        that's already out there.</p>

<p>We no longer need to wait. The book is called <a href="http://www.manning.com/janert/">Gnuplot in Action</a> by Philipp Janert, and it is an absolutely fantastic       book. Really, I can't say enough good about it.</p>

<p>Janert walks the fine line between cheesy tutorial and dense reference with the  skill of a circus acrobat. The writing is approachable, yet chock full of       useful information. Nothing is rushed, but it doesn't plod. The text is         sprinkled with beautiful graphs that expand your imagination and open your      eyes to the possibilities of gnuplot.</p>

<p>In chapter 2, "Essential Gnuplot", the impatient reader is given a whirlwind     tour of gnuplot basics. After just 11 pages you will know everything you need   to know for 90% of the graphs you will ever need to create. In fact, you'll     know more than I knew when I began reading it—I learned a couple things that I kick myself for never having discovered on my own. </p>

<p>Chapter 3 goes into more detail on dealing with data, and in that chapter I      learned a <em>ton</em>. Several of the things I learned in this chapter have saved me  numerous hours this semester alone. Chapter 4 picks up the remaining            miscellany.</p>

<p>In part 2, all those nagging questions of polish are addressed. This is where I  used to spend the most time banging my head against the wall, searching,        plodding through various newsgroup threads. "How do I get this or that to look  just right?" These types of questions are hard to find answers to in search     engines. Janert takes us by the hand and explains each and every question I've  ever had and a few I hadn't yet dared to have. Truly beautiful graphs are now   within my grasp. What's more, it no longer seems like an exercise in pain but   a simple recipe for success. After Janert explains these techniques they seem   plain as the nose on your face, yet he's not condescending.</p>

<p>Part 3 dives into the deep dark secrets of gnuplot. 3D plots, color,             multiplots, different coordinate systems, fitting, terminals, and a dozen       other things you didn't even know that you didn't want to know. No doubt        you'll skim this section the first time and come back to it when you need       those dark magic tidbits.</p>

<p>Part 4 is arguably the most important part of this book, or perhaps second       after part 1. Part 4 is a crash course on graphical analysis. What kinds of     graphs you can create, when you should and shouldn't use them, how not to lie   with graphs (and how to pick out people lying with graphs), and most            importantly, how to go from raw data that you don't understand to organized     data that you do understand and have pretty graphs to demonstrate to boot. All
 with practical examples that you can tweak for your own use.</p>

<p>Finally, there's a gnuplot reference in the appendix. This is a deluxe package   and has everything you need to become a gnuplot guru. I am thrilled that this   book is coming to dispel the darkness surrounding gnuplot.</p>

<p>I really have no cons to speak of, other than the prerelease PDF I had access    to had some minor problems—the sort of problem I would expect to be resolved    in the final stages of editing. I don't have experience with other Manning      books, but having seen prerelease versions of other books from other            publishers I'd say the current copy is par for the course. I'm certain they'll
 fix those things up and have an outstanding PDF in the end. I recommend         springing for the dead tree version though, as I expect the reference at the    end of the book and the examples throughout will be more accessible next to     your computer instead of on the screen. (You already use quite a bit of real    estate running gnuplot and/or editing a gnuplot file and displaying graphs.)</p>
