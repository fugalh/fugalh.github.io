<p><a href="http://gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> has some pretty nifty features for small
business these days. Herman Oosthuysen has a <a href="http://linas.org/mirrors/www.aerospacesoftware.com/2003.06.21/GNU_Cash_for_Business_users_Howto_Guide.html">good
writeup</a>,
although it is a bit dated. I wouldn't follow it step-for-step since many of
the details have changed and GnuCash has a good set of basic business accounts,
and I'm not in Canada. But it's a good read.</p>

<p>One thing I had a hard time with was figuring out how to pay myself and how to
account for things I bought for the business with personal funds. The magic
word here is <em>Equity</em>. Paying yourself is debit equity, credit asset. Paying
for a business expense out of a personal account is essentially a form of
investing in your business, so it is debit expense, credit equity. I use
GnuCash's Equity:Retained Earnings account for taking owner draws, and created
an Equity:Owner Contributions account for investments.</p>
