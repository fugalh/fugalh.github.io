<p><a href="http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html">QCad</a> is a really nifty open-source 2D
CAD program for POSIX systems. They don't distribute free binaries, though, so
you have to build it yourself.</p>

<p>There's two catches when building. First is trying to figure out where to
start. It looks to me like this is the starting point:</p>

<pre><code>cd scripts
./build_qcad.sh notrans
</code></pre>

<p>The second catch is if you get an error about ISO C++ and 'long long'. This
actually applies to Qt in general, but I know that my Qt build environment is
fine so I was a little confused. Turns out that the <code>-pedantic</code> compiler flag
is what brings this error to the surface. So this patch will fix your QCad
build:</p>

<p>What do I need QCad for? I'm designing two Really Neat&trade; DIY projects: a
keyboard stand and a compact against-the-wall under-the-keyboard music stand.
If that piqued your interest, stay tuned. If it didn't, well I'm sorry for you.</p>
