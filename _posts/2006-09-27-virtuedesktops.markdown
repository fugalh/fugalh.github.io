  content: <p>Just installed it, and I have to say that it rocks. I'm really impressed.
    The interface isn't as intuitive as I'd like, but then again I can actually tweak
    it really well. I'm very happy.</p>

<p>For almost a year and a half I have used OS X as my primary user interface. I
don't switch back to Linux for the ironic reason that keyboard shortcuts are
more useful and usable in OS X. But I've always missed virtual desktops, until
now. </p>

<p>I always figured it really couldn't be all that hard to do this right, and it
boggled my mind that nobody ever did. I tried a few that didn't do it right,
and doing it wrong is worse than not doing it. But
<a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/">VirtueDesktops</a> does a fantastic job. I can lay
out my desktops in a grid, I can use the keys <em>I</em> want to use to switch, and if
I switch applications I'm taken to the desktop hosting that application. It's
perfection. Finally.</p>
