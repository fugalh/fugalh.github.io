    <p>The figure-8 technique is used for kite strings on a stunt kite or a power kite.  Some people recommend always using the same hand and same direction as well.  Not as important for headphones probably.</p>

    <p>I'll definitely have to learn this over/under technique for the ridiculously long power cord that came with my weed whacker though.  That thing has been a royal pain every week.</p>

    <p>Actually, just as important for most cables as it is for kite string. In both cases you want to avoid twisting causing damage. Electrical wires are just as if not more susceptible to damage from twisting as kite string.</p>

    <p>That's the "bad for them" I alluded to in the post. Starting with the same end and same hand is a good idea for that same reason.</p>

<p>Have you ever rolled a cable? Maybe I should ask, how many cables do you roll a day? Don't forget the headphones, laptop power cord, extension cords, hoses, etc.</p>

<p>And what happens every single time you go to unroll one of these cables? They get all tangled up. Guaranteed.</p>

<p>Well it doesn't have to be like that. There is a simple way to roll cables that is easy, avoids tangles, and lies well. Well, actually, two waysâ€”one for big cables and one for small ones like headphones. Oh, and did I mention it's good for the cables, and the way you have been doing it is bad for the cables?</p>

<p>For the big cables, watch this video. Go on, I'll wait.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JUz266TU9JE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/JUz266TU9JE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>

<p>For small cables, like headphones, raise your index and pinky fingers and wrap the cable around them in a figure eight. The figure eight nature does the same thing as the over/under technique for larger cables, preventing tangles, and it also makes a nice compact easy-to-stash roll.
