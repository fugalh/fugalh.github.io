    <p>I want to try the opposite. As you may know ,the C5 corvette has a AM FM antenna in the front windshield, very stylish, but not very strong. I want to try my copper coil antenna from my scanner. It is only 10 inches long and should fit in the radio cavity. </p>

<p>In a <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2007/12/31/scanner-and-antenna.html">previous post</a> I talked about my new scanner and my early antenna adventures. Now I am happily set up and done playing with antennas, so I thought I'd tell you what the final verdict is. Also, it has been requested that I post some pictures. The pictures are <a href="http://foton.fugal.net/album/99">here</a>, and I'll embed some of them in this post.</p>

<p>The antenna I'm using is actually not the one I described making in the previous post. It would have worked fine, but I found the functional equivalent at Radio Shack for $5, only slightly more robust. Here's a picture:</p>

<p><a href="http://foton.fugal.net/foto/1424"><img src="http://foton.fugal.net/foto/1424/thumbnail" alt="Clipped FM Antenna"/></a></p>

<p>It is sold as an FM antenna. I think the package said dipole, but it's actually a folded dipole. I clipped the ends to <a href="http://www.kwarc.org/ant-calc.html">match my target frequency</a>, then soldered the leads together and put some electrical tape on for protection. Even when it was just an FM antenna it got better reception than the rubber duckie.</p>

<p>It is attached to the radio via a TV balun (300立 to 75立) and a female TV-style coax to male BNC adapter:</p>

<p><a href="http://foton.fugal.net/foto/1425"><img src="http://foton.fugal.net/foto/1425/thumbnail" alt="Scanner"/></a></p>

<p>I also constructed a dipole using coat hangers and electrical tape. I need to get a connector for this, since the balun is unnecessary, but even when I hook it up to the balun it does very well. I think the coat hanger being thicker helps. I think it even outperforms the folded dipole, both my custom one (not shown) and the FM antenna. A bit unwieldy though, compared to the FM antenna.</p>

<p>Speaking of baluns, I asked an expert and his unofficial opinion is that for reception only impedance mismatch isn't a big deal. Certainly seems to be the case in my limited experience (even with the TV balun, it's 75立 when the scanner nominally wants 50立). Still, the TV balun makes a nice adapter, and it can't hurt. They're very cheap, too.</p>
