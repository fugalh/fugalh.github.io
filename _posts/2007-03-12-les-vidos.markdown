<p>In a quest for technique tips on baguette forming, I found a page at <a href="http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/1680">The Fresh
Loaf</a> with some great tips on bread
slashing. Even more importantly, the page includes a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVSh0iLiAos&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ethefreshloaf%2Ecom%2Fnode%2F1680">nice
video</a>.
I don't like the bread with such deep slashes, I prefer shallow and more
slashes. In any case, the technique tips are pretty good.</p>

<p>But the real gem here is the link to <a href="http://lepetitboulanger.com/">Le Petit
Boulanger</a> which is le site de la boulangerie
artisanale. I don't speak french, but I know enough to follow the silent videos
(with one exception) posted in the
<a href="http://lepetitboulanger.com/video.htm">Vid√©os</a> page. They are excellent videos
of a real boulanger showing you how it's done. Notice how supple the dough is -
obviously fairly high hydration. Notice how firmly but gracefully he moves the
lame. Notice his neat coat.</p>

<p>So anyway, my conclusion is that the scalpel I got from the bookstore is
probably not sharp enough. I'm going to get me some coffee sticks and
double-edged razor blades and use a more acute angle. Hopefully I'll stop
tearing the loaf and get some nice slashes like the ones you see in those
videos.</p>
