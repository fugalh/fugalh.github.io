    <p>So how do you <em>really</em> feel about Stuffit???  I just can't get through all the hints...</p>

    <p>But don't feel too bad.  I hate Stuffit too.</p>

<p>I wish StuffIt would just die, already. I'm sick of running into <code>.sit</code> and <code>.hqx</code> files. Thankfully these are quite rare, and usually an indication that the project is ancient and unmaintained. If you ever find you do need to open one, though, head on over to <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">The Unarchiver</a>. Do not under any circumstances even visit the StuffIt website. Only you can prevent StuffIt fires!</p>

<p>I'm sick of Firefox asking me if I want to open archive files (zip, tar, etc.) with "StuffIt Expander (Default)". Earth to Firefox! StuffIt Expander hasn't been included with the OS for several versions now. It is not and never will be installed on my computer. Incidentally, it works just fineâ€”opening files with the appropriate application. In other words, Firefox is a big fat liar. But we knew that.</p>

<p>I applaud Apple for finally dropping StuffIt a few years back. There has never, ever been a good reason (other than "I'm stuck in the 1990s OS 9 mac scene") to use StuffIt on OS X. Please join us in the 21st century. Use zip, tar+gzip, or tar+bzip2. Even better (for OS X recipients) use a <code>.dmg</code>. For the love of all that is green, do not do <code>.dmg.sit</code>! You won't get any more compression over a compressed disk image, and you will only make rational people foam at the mouth.</p>

<p>Die. <em>Die</em>. <em>DIE</em>.</p>
