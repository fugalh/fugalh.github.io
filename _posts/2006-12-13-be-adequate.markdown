<blockquote>
    <p>"That was adequate" is the catchphrase you'd have heard Monday on the set of
    "Prairie Home," shooting this month at the Fitzgerald Theater. It's a
    favorite way for director Robert Altman to indicate he's shot enough takes of
    a scene. When an actor gets a "more than adequate," says Virginia Madsen, who
    plays an angel, "that means it's good." (<a href="http://www.robinandlinda.com/moviereview8.html">Hewitt</a>)</p>

<p>That's someone else's words that catch the gist of <acronym title="Garrison Keillor">GK</acronym>'s introduction to "Make it Adequate". It was pretty enjoyable, but more than that, it made me think. And then I thought some more. And now I will share my thoughts about being adequate.</p>

<p>A large part of success, the largest part I wager, is just showing up and doing "it". Want to succeed in school? Read the book <em>before</em> class, show up to class, and do the homework. Want to be a skilled musician (erm, I mean skilled performer)? Practice every day for an hour for a couple of years. Want to be a l337 programmer? Write lots of programs. </p>

<p>Altman, GK, et al aren't the first ones to come up with or inspire this idea. President Kimball said "Do It". Nike said "Just Do It" (but I think they were just trying to sell shoes). 37 Signals has a whole book on the concept applied to web programming, called <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>. You've heard the phrases "just dive in", "show up", and "release early, release often" and others like them. </p>

<p>The place I've seen the tendency to not just do it in my life, is in software. I have a tendency to overdesign things. I like designing and dreaming more than sitting down and implementing. It's good to have a good design. It's better to have software running. I try to let my feet hit the pavement after the basic design phase (if I decide to do the project at all - another importan mantra is "don't bite off more than you can chew"), and when I do I feel more successful and have more to show for my work.</p>

<p>Don't get caught up in overanalysis or overperfection. Just go do it and be adequate in many things. You'll like the result better than being perfect in a couple of things.</p>

<p>Listen to the <a href="http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2006/11/25/">November 25, 2006 A Prairie Home Companion</a> online, at least to the first few minutes of <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/tools/media/player/phc/2006/11/25_phc?start=00:00:28:30.0&amp;end=00:01:05:22.0">Segment 2</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, I thought that <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0420087/">the movie</a> was adequate. It was interesting to see how the show works on stage and to see GK instead of just hear him.</p>
