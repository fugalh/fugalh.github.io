    <p>Interesting analysis.</p>

    <p>I've come across some articles lately which suggests intervals training have a higher impact on total work capacity (VO2max), than either longer periods of lower intensity or shorter periods of higher intensity exercise alone. But then runners have known about fartlek training for a long time.</p>

    <p>I find it remarkable how big a shovel one needs to dig through the manure of exercise advice. Excess precision is a big failing.</p>

    <p>Thanks!</p>

    <p>I’m happy to see that you are including some work in the anaerobic zones for portions of your workout.  That is good.  Let me give you another reason to do so.</p>

    <p>Anaerobic work, because it is coupled with maximal muscle contractions – or close to it, stimulates hypertrophy or muscle growth.  Aerobic workouts, especially the lengthy type that triathlon athletes must do to be competitive, are actually catabolic or muscle wasting.</p>

    <p>Let me give you an anecdotal example.  I recently watched TV highlights the world track and field championships which were held in Japan this summer.  I couldn’t help but notice that the sprinters’ bodies were both very low body fat and very high musculature.  And the high level of muscle development was general, not just in the legs.  On the other hand, the marathon runners, who also had very low body fat levels, had very little muscle development.  Many of them, especially the top female competitors, looked like they had just been released from the Auschwitz concentration camp.  Sprinters’ training is primarily anaerobic.  Marathoner’s training is primarily aerobic.</p>

    <p>I understand that there are many factors that enter into this picture.  One cannot credit the training methods for the entire difference between marathoners and sprinters.  Skinny body type athletes will naturally gravitate to the long distance events while the more powerful, muscular types will naturally gravitate to the sprint events.  However, a huge percentage of the difference can be attributed to training.</p>

    <p>Why do we see this difference?  Maximal muscle contraction workouts, especially when large muscles are involved, stimulate the endocrine system to increase the levels of the various hormones responsible for greater muscle development.  Also, after any workout the muscles are low in energy stores; protein breakdown is in high gear which results in catabolism; and protein synthesis has stopped, which means no muscle reconstruction.  This catabolic condition will persist for a couple of hours after an anaerobic workout but will last several times longer after a hard endurance or aerobic workout.  This condition will eventually reverse to anabolism with proper post-workout and recovery period nutrition.  But for the endurance athlete, the recovery is just too slow.</p>

    <p>Why is this important for the non-athlete who is just trying to loose weight and increase general fitness?  While aerobic exercise is superior at burning fat during the exercise period, what happens during the other 23 hours a day is even more important. The best way to increase the rate that calories are burned during each of those 23 hours is to increase the lean body mass.  On the track, that means interval sprints instead of long steady runs.  In the weight room that means pushing heavy weight for fewer reps rather than using light weights for more reps.  In the pool that means interval sprints where each stroke is producing close to maximal muscle force instead of long periods of steady lap swimming.</p>

    <p>Am I suggesting that you should not do any aerobic exercise?  Not at all.  Increasing your aerobic capacity in important for a number of reasons.  I personally try to get three anaerobic workouts and two aerobic workouts in per week.   I don’t usually get all five workouts in each week, but that’s a whole other issue …</p>

    <p>Since I am a wanna-be strength athlete, I naturally have a bias toward strength training which is primarily anaerobic.  When I throw the discus, hammer or other heavy object, or when I toss a sheaf or turn a caber, it’s all anaerobic.  That need has led my studies down a road less traveled.  Most of the literature out there, including the book you are reviewing, is aimed at endurance athletes because that is where the greater numbers are.  Endurance athletes must do a lot of aerobic training to be successful in their sport!  The result is that most literature overemphasizes aerobic training.  Try putting on a community 5K or 10K run or a triathlon.  How many participants will you get?  Now try a community 200 meter sprint competition.  How many participants will you have this time?  Get the point?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still swimming. This may be the longest I&#8217;ve stuck with any exercise program (excluding things thrust upon me like basketball practice or getting out of bed). Naturally, being the technical sort that I am, I want to make sure I&#8217;m using this exercise time efficiently, so I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1569755620/thefug-20">Total Heart Rate Training</a> by Joe Friel at the bookstore (and put it down before I left—reading it over several visits while my son played with the Thomas trains). This is an informative book with lots of information, but it&#8217;s not for the weak of heart—literally or figuratively. The book is written by and for obsessive-compulsive athletes (the most common variety is known as triathlete). You have to be absolutely bonkers to follow this book religiously. But it can be useful to the thinking fitness swimmer, with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The first problem with this book is precision. Not a lack thereof but an overabundance and misunderstanding of it. In physics, or any practical math, you can get in trouble by giving more significant digits than your measurements warrant. You can fool yourself and others into thinking you have more precision than you do, which leads people to jump to incorrect conclusions and make silly and/or dangerous decisions. Heart rate monitors will give you absurdly accurate heart rate measurements. But I posit that you can&#8217;t measure how that maps to your body&#8217;s metabolism (the zones) with anywhere near that accuracy, at least not while exercising. What&#8217;s more, as a swimmer anyway, you can only check the monitor during rests at the end of the pool, where it&#8217;s just as convenient to take your pulse with the pace clock (it takes 6 seconds to get ±5 bpm). The heart rate charts in the appencides are what really give it away, though. Running, Biking, Swimming, etc. each have their own 2-page chart with some 60-odd entries on where the zones begin and end, to the nearest bpm. If that doesn&#8217;t sound absurd by itself, take a look at this graph I made from the swimming chart:</p>

<p><img src="http://hans.fugal.net/images/swimming_heartrate.png" alt="Swimming Heart Rate Zones"/></p>

<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Notice how the relationship is almost completely linear. I&#8217;m no exercise scientist, but how much do you want to bet the body is not so perfectly conformant? I bet it varies depending on the day, conditions, what you ate, etc. There might even be some nonlinearities. So we have a chart with a bunch of numbers and no graph, that is overly precise.</p>

<p>That wouldn&#8217;t be so bad on its own, but the author actively disparages traditional measures and formulas for being too inaccurate, when of course the reason they are too inaccurate is that they are too precise. The most obvious example is that your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. This gives you a bpm, but really it&#8217;s only good to within 10 or 20 bpm. He rightly says that this is not accurate. But he says it&#8217;s as likely to be way wrong as not, because it&#8217;s a statistical measurement. i.e. it&#8217;s a bell curve. Hello, 95% confidence of being within 2 standard deviations hardly qualifies as &#8220;as likely as not&#8221; to be outside. If he really wanted to convince me he would have stated the confidence intervals and said just how far off from that number you are likely to be. Then he would have compared that error with the error in pinpointing the zones in exercise. I think we&#8217;d find that maximum heart rate, while not perfect, isn&#8217;t as bad as all that.</p>

<p>While being absurdly precise and complicated (to the delight of obsessive compulsive triathletes everywhere), this book is also somewhat lacking in rigor and logic. Besides the examples above, there&#8217;s an issue I blogged about previously: the so-called fat-burning zone. As you may recall, the fact is that your body burns more fat per calorie when in an aerobic metabolism. This leads people to call the aerobic zone the fat-burning zone. People get lazy and forget to put in the disclaimer that you have to work longer to burn as many calories, which leads to confusion. Trainers and self-righteous OC athletes retaliate by pointing out that you burn more calories per time unit by working out harder—up into anaerobic, and so &#8220;the fat-burning zone is a myth&#8221;. Well it&#8217;s not a myth, it&#8217;s perfectly valid if you&#8217;re willing to work out longer. Instead of elucidating the topic with clarity and stating both sides of the issue without bias, the author falls squarely, if not extremely, on the myth side.</p>

<p>Still, there is a lot of good information in here on how the body works, what&#8217;s going on in the various zones, in which zones you can best spend your exercise time in order to achieve your goals (the information for a fitness swimmer is in there, if a bit hidden behind the triathlete-like goals). Numbers that are useful if you take into account that they are too precise, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give you an oversimplified summary of what I learned in the book. Referring to that graph above (by the way, I had no control on which colors were used—they&#8217;re just GNUPlot&#8217;s default colors), notice that the x axis is the lactate threshold. He claims that LT is a better base point than maximum heart rate, because you can directly observe it without killing yourself. Sounds good to me. </p>

<p>At the border of zones 1 and 2, aerobic respiration accounts for almost all of the energy produced. Aerobic respiration primarily uses fat and is much more efficient, but less powerful, than anaerobic respiration. If you&#8217;re fit you can stay in zone 2 all day long.</p>

<p>At the border of zones 4 and 5, enough anaerobic respiration is happening that various easily-observable changes occur, and the exercise benefits change too (especially those related to heart). Oversimply put, training above LT will train for speed in shorter (non-endurance) races, and also do various good things for your heart. </p>

<p>At the border of zones 5b and 5c, almost no aerobic respiration is occuring—it&#8217;s all anaerobic. This is because you&#8217;re demanding more power than aerobic respiration can keep up with. Anaerobic respiration is done not from fat stores but from stuff stored in the muscles themselves (for immediate access and powerful energy). There&#8217;s only so much of this fuel, so you run out of steam quickly above LT, but especially up here. This is sprinting stuff, and you can rarely keep it up long enough to even measure heart rates much into zone 5c.</p>

<p>For me, I am going to aim at increasing my LT and staying mostly in zones 2 and 4, (apparently zone 3 is a waste—little more benefit than zone 2 but requiring a lot more recovery) but doing interval training shooting up into the above-LT zones, mostly for the heart benefits. I figure that will meet my goals best, i.e. I will enjoy the exercise more and not leave the pool exhausted, I will burn more fat per calorie, and the interval training will give me enough edge to keep things interesting and improve my cardiovascular health (not to mention increase LT—doing intervals with sufficient rest to &#8220;cycle&#8221; the heart rate from low to high and back to low is one good way to do that). And I&#8217;m going to do it by taking my pulse with the pace clock periodically, and paying attention to how my body feels and how hard I&#8217;m breathing.</p>

<p>Of course, the most important thing is to keep on just doing it, and that&#8217;s going well because I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Total Immersion swimming method, and I&#8217;m finaly getting into the more interesting drills. It won&#8217;t be too long until I graduate to swimming again, at which point I&#8217;ll review that book. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing if I can swim a 500m in under 10 minutes with ease. That&#8217;s something I had to do regularly as a lifeguard and even though I was more fit then (or at least less fat) I always struggled with swimming 500m non-stop, and my times were usually 10-12 minutes. If I can swim a 500m with ease in under 10 minutes in my current shape, it will be a testament to the TI method. Stay tuned!</p>
