<p>I got a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card which is driven by the cs46xx ALSA
driver, but much to my dismay there doesn't seem to be a way to get its
wavetable MIDI synthesis to work in linux. So I guess it's back to the
softsynths for me, e.g. fluidsynth. They're not so bad, but I think the card
would have done a better job of it.</p>

<p>Still, it's a good card.</p>
