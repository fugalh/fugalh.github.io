    <p>Ditto on the congrats!  It's a special thing to have a baby just days or even hours old.  Really is amazing.  Glad all is well.</p>

    <p>And ah, no comment on the name :)</p>

    <p>Laters,
    Gabe</p>

<p>Friday, November 30. It was a dark and stormy night. Erin began having regular contractions and about 5 hours later Lachlan Pádraig Fugal was born. He escaped just in time to see most of the last half hour of November. </p>

<p>He weighed 3.86kg and was 49.5cm long. For those of you stuck in the past, that's 0.6 stone and 58 barleycorns. </p>

<p>We're glad to have him with us and we're happy to report that we're all doing fine, even Jonathan. </p>

<p>I suppose you're dying to know more about the name. Lachlan is of Gaelic origin
and means "from the land of the lochs," i.e. the Vikings. Pádraig is the old
Gaelic spelling of Patrick, and is pronounced something like PAH-drig but
leaning towards Patrick. You can just say Patrick, but don't say "pa-DRAYG" or
we'll laugh at you. Fugal of course comes from the Danish Fugl which means
bird. Erin wasn't going for my "crazy" Scandinavian names, and I was not too
keen on Christopher or Christian, so we were at an impasse for awhile. Somehow
Lachlan slipped through her "craziness" filters and we tried it out for a day.
We think it's a delightful name; strong and cute and with lots of meaning and
family heritage, just like Jonathan Frederik Fugal, his older brother.</p>
