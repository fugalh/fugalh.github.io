<p>I finally got around to borrowing a dutch oven and trying Lahey's no-knead
recipe on its own terms. I rewatched <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/index.jsp?fr_story=35eac03d90314ffed6a0c0ae143ab87b1474fb89">the
video</a>,
reread <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=8b6cb6dd63075c05&amp;ex=1320642000&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">the
article</a>,
and followed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html?ex=1172984400&amp;en=3c99462c10cafa29&amp;ei=5070">the
recipe</a>
faithfully (with the exception of using 1.5 cups water like Lahey said instead
of 1 5/8 cups).</p>

<p>Now, I've done the no-knead recipe dozens of times, with my own variations.
Namely, I didn't have a dutch oven so I cooked it on the stone (or in a loaf
pan) like I always do, and I prefer to keep the hydration down between 66% and
75%, not the 82% or so that Lahey's recipe calls for. So I was not surprised
when the dough was very sticky and very difficult to work with. It stuck to
<em>everything</em>, and had latched onto the parchment paper with such gusto that I
thought it was a lost cause. I did finally manage to separate the two and douse
it in flour enough to be manageable. Then I baked it in the dutch oven as
directed.  The result was absolutely wonderful. Great crust, great color, great
crumb.</p>

<p>I tried it a couple of times this week, with different variables. One
sourdough, one regular yeast, both at about 66% to 70% hydration.  My wife, the
impartial and tell-it-like-it-is judge of my baking, said all three dutch oven
attempts were basically the same. She doesn't like the crisp crust; she prefers
boring sandwich loaves, but she loved it nevertheless. I did much prefer the
crust to my normal crust, if only because my normal crust gets quite thick and
chewy and makes eating the bread after a day or two quite unpleasant in spite
of how good it tastes.</p>

<p>Lahey scoops and shakes 3 cups of flour, and then adds 1.5 cups of water. I
tried packing in the flour to get up to the 6 oz per cup that you need to get
the hydration into the low 70s. I couldn't do it, not in a believable way. I
get about 5 oz per cup of flour. So Lahey must really be dealing with 83%
hydration dough. I've no doubt he can manage it, but mere mortals will
struggle. So I've modified his recipe to use a bit less water, so we have 73%
hydration. Still quite a bit wetter than any grandma-method recipe, but
manageable with a bit of flour or butterfingers.</p>

<p>I feel like I've reached a milestone in my bread journey. If you'll allow me to
reminisce... I started out making a loaf here and there a few years back.
Standard grandma-method. Then I delved into Whole Wheat and tried to learn the
dark art of bread making from the inside out. Then I began to ask the hard
questions: Does steam matter? (It does) How does kneading and hydration affect
things? What about additives? Sourdough vs. baker's yeast? And on and on...
Soon I was a relative master of the complicated beast that is bread. But once I
had figured things out, it got really unfun to have to do all that complicated
stuff just to get some bread every week. And then, almost out of the blue, all
the ducks lined up (Lahey's video was a big part of this) and truly great and
simple bread snapped into focus for me.</p>

<p>So without further ado I give you <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/noknead.pdf">my final adaptation of Lahey's
recipe</a>. I tried to cut it down and make it
even simpler than Bittman's recipe. I modified the hydration to bring it down
to a manageable level, which still produces excellent bread. I definitely
recommend using a dutch oven or other enclosed pot, as it is the simplest and
most reliable way to get the steam that makes all the difference to the crust,
and the recipe reflects that. (I'll be purchasing a dutch oven Real Soon Nowâ„¢
too. Anyone want to buy a stoneware baker?)</p>
