    <p>One thing I would recommend is reading the Planet archives and seeing what other people hate about it and what others have done to address it.  It might serve as a "sneak peek" into the types of issues that you will no doubt encounter.  Feeds can be ugly - shouldn't be, but often are.</p>

    <p>Also, study the approach they have taken.  While it leaves a few things to be desired, it's really flexible and makes good use of existing components.</p>

    <p>My <em>big</em> beef with the project is that it's not aggressively pushed forward.  Maybe now that Jeff W. is no longer with Canonical, it will move more quickly.</p>

    <p>You might want to check out the plagger system <a href="http://plagger.org/trac" rel="nofollow">http://plagger.org/trac</a></p>

    <p>This system is pretty darn powerful, and can do a lot of the legwork for you.  Think of it as being able to have a good pipe service for rss aggregation.  Not only could we have it doing a nicer planet style presentation, but also feeds to ibot/brac, personalized filters, etc.</p>

    <p>Just think, finally being able to filter out $other_blogger</p>

    be open to having one of our Ruby teams work on it with your guidance.</p>

  content: <p>I wish I knew ruby well enough to tackle this because this actually
    is something that I've had an interest in and I have implemented a few of the
    pieces to this in the past using tcl.  I've hacked something somewhat resembling
    what you've mentioned together using python as well for myself.</p>

<p>We discussed on <code>#utah</code> today how much we all hate
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a>. And we're just the end users. We feel
for you Gabe.</p>

<p>The consensus was that it's stupid that planet is so stupid but nobody wants to
tackle a replacement because dealing with 53 flavors of RSS is a royal pain. </p>

<p>But there are libraries for that sort of thing. Ruby has a promising lib called <a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/">FeedTools</a> that would make a planet-killer a piece of cake. It even does the caching.</p>

<p>The web part would be a straightforward excercise in Rails. Surely someone out
there wants to do a little rails work under my tutelage. I'm not Ye Olde Rails
Guru, but I've done a few Rails apps and I know Ruby back and forth. I'd be
willing to give you instruction and guidance if you do all the work. I can't
justify the time to write it myself, see, but I can help you out.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you've decided you might want to take this project on, let me give
you the "specs". </p>

<p>First, the name. It will be called Mars. Mars is a red planet,
see?</p>

<p>Second, the core. At its core it is a feed aggregator. There's lots of these
things out there to steal code from, and with FeedTools it's pretty easy. You
periodically get feeds and then regurgitate them as one unified feed on demand.
After all the effort they've put into the hackergotchis we'd better include those in the core too.</p>

<p>Third, the icing. Let's focus on a few key icing features. The admin should be
able to set the update frequency on a per-feed basis, and optionally turn off
updating.  Instant-update via pings would be awesome. Have users that can
select which feeds they want to subscribe to so not everyone has to listen to
my drivel. If you're really gung-ho you can make it so that you can group feeds
and people can choose only the groups they're interested in. If you're really,
really gung-ho you can figure out some sort of tagging and/or AI tagging...
we'd better stop there.</p>

<p>There, I've got that off my chest. If you want to pick up this ball and run,
I'll be your cheerleader and coach. Or maybe I'll delete this post and pretend
I never wrote it. In any case, now I can get on with what I'm supposed to be
doing and leave this Yak to graze.</p>
