<p>I got QtRuby working perfectly on my iBook. It wasn't easy, but it's
reproduceable. I wrote up the instructions on ruby-talk, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_frm/thread/fd7daa4329cd199a/c8712d8363237b92?tvc=1#c8712d8363237b92">go read
them</a>
and let me know if it doesn't work for you.</p>
