  content: A new cable fixed it. I don't think it's a quality issue, probably a connector
    fit issue. i.e. I'm blaming the BD player for having a bit too large a connector.

HDMI out on my Sony BDP-360 BluRay player worked fine for a month or two, then mysteriously cut out. I'm still troubleshooting, and the unit may need repair, but when I contacted Sony support they sent me this link which has already been very helpful: <a href="http://www.kb.sony.com/selfservice/documentLink.do?externalId=C567099">http://www.kb.sony.com/selfservice/documentLink.do?externalId=C567099</a>

It may be coincidence but twice in a row I held down the stop button for 10+ seconds then replugged the HDMI cable, and it came back. I have it on 720p now and if it doesn't cut out again I'll assume some kind of 1080p problem, e.g. I need a better cable or there's some EM interference or something.

Tangentially, the player has a quirk in audio output. It refuses to send the full audio signal over HDMI to the TV, even though the TV passes a digital signal through to my receiver. I know this works because MythTV send Dolby Digital 5.1 audio through HDMI, which is then passed from the TV to my receiver unharmed. But I can't get more than stereo downmixed dolby surround from this BD player, except if I hook up the digital audio out directly to the receiver. This is annoying because I have to switch the TV input source and the receiver both.
