  content: "This is very close to what I do too.  People are always trying to get
    me to use fancy to-do or organization apps, but I've found the flexibility of
    basic text files suits me best.  (Only difference is I use Google Docs (or *drive*
    or whatever) so I can easily access them anywhere.)\r\n\r\n(BTW, found your blog
    via the 'sensible graphs with cacti' post, which was nice because it immediately
    confirmed my suspicion on setting up Cacti for the first time that the load average
    graph made exactly zero sense. :) )"

Lately in my TODO usage, a pattern has emerged. It's actually rather helpful, and it's dead simple.

I just keep a text file; one for work, one for my dissertation, and one for personal stuff. It's free-form, but roughly divided into 3 sections. First the page table, then the core, and finally the metadata. Yes, I really just pretended my TODO list is a virtual memory system.

In English, the first part is a refresher/jump starter. It's just a list of what's next: what I hope to accomplish today or this week. The hardest part is always starting the next task, and I find it immensely helpful to do the prioritizing once in the morning or perhaps the beginning of the week, and then I can refer to a short and ordered list of things I plan to do, and no effort is wasted hem-hawing about what to do next. (Often, life is interrupt-driven and I don't actually get to what's on my list.)

Then I have the actual list of all the things I need to do, categorized however is useful for that particular file. For work, I have sections of the various task priorities (unbreak now, hi-pri, mid-pri, low-pri), and also groupings by project (most low-pri stuff makes more sense grouped by project because it's usually done opportunistically and/or when I feel like working on that project.) Most of the tasks of any substance actually have tasks in our task tracking thing for collaboration, and most of the details are there. These are just one-line reminders. For my dissertation, it's a more traditional list and an outline of what still needs writing. A little structure but no rules.

Finally, the "metadata" is just notes and free-form text that is relevant to the TODO list but not an actual list itself. Totally free-form.

It's been working well for me, it's surprisingly effective. Together with my notebook where I regularly write out my thoughts as a sort of log to get my juices flowing (especially when I'm feeling stuck), it's a great low(ish) tech solution to staying on top of things and avoiding that overwhelming panic feeling when you can't figure out what to do next, or worse can't remember everything you have to do.
