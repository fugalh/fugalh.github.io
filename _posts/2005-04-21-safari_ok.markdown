<p>Well it turns out Safari can do tabs, they're just not enabled by default.
Safari does some OS X things well enough that I'm using it as my primary
browser. It's actually easier to open links in a new tab than Firefox
(command-click instead of command-option-click). It looks more OS X-like,
although Firefox doesn't look bad either. But the real benefit, at least at
this stage of my usage, is that it runs .dmg and so on automatically upon
download so I don't have to go fishing for the file I just downloaded. I do
miss the status bar, though.</p>

<p>In other news, iTunes almost got rejected flat out because it didn't support
ogg vorbis. The best alternative from my quick search (after xmms from fink
didn't work out of the box) was something called Audion, which is so far the
only program to crash hard on the iBook for me (kill worked wonders, though).
It was pretty ugly, to boot, so I got the ogg quicktime component for iTunes. I
imagine if I ever do serious long-period listening on the iBook (and I
eventually will when I'm at NMSU, I'm sure) then it will probably be back to
IMMS and XMMS (or some other compatible media player), because I am wholly
addicted to IMMS.</p>
