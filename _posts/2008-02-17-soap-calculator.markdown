  content: <p>Wow thanks very much. This should put my soap recipe to the accuracy
    test. I am trying to make one that rivals the moisture of Dove.</p>

    changes/fixes. If you downloaded it previously, go get it again.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2008/02/16/measurement-error-in-soapmaking.html">my last post</a> made your head spin, you're not alone. It made mine spin too when I was conceiving and writing it.</p>

<p>For your sanity and mine, I have put together a soap calculator spreadsheet. You tell it the precision of your scale, how much of each fat you want (sorry, you have to specify the saponification value too, but there's a reference chart included), and your target lye discount. It tells you how much lye and water or milk to use. It also tells you how the measurement error effects your expected lye discount, and warns you if your soap might turn out lye-heavy. You can easily scale the recipe arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Download the calculator and my recipes at <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/soap">http://hans.fugal.net/soap</a>.</p>
