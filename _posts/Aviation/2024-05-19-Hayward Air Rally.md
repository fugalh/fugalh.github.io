Katie and I flew in the 60th [Hayward Air Rally](http://www.hwdairrally.org/) a few days ago. It's a proficiency competition: you provide estimates for timing and fuel for a long cross-country flight, and your score is based on how close you are to your estimates.

It was a blast! We took 7th place out of 20, the 2nd rookie place out of 5 (by one point). A very respectable showing I think. I knew I would like it and have been looking forward to it since last year when I just missed the registration deadline. But it was more fun than I thought and Katie enjoyted it more than either of us thought she would too.

Here's my [flight track](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N761S/history/20240518/1952Z/KHWD/KLVK).

I geek out about plane performance and flight planning. Some might even say obsess. So I loved the chance to be on top of my game and half the fun was the preparation going into being ready to fly the rally. I've been doing test flights to check how calibrated my airspeed indicator is, my compass, finding ways to consistently and accurately measure and predict fuel consumption, etc. And practicing those basic but sometimes elusive skills like straight and level flight on a constant (compass) heading. 

I flew analog, meaning no GPS or DME. And fuel was of course analog as I have no digital fuel totalizer or any of that fancy stuff. Paper charts, dead reckoning and pilotage, dealing with compass dip, the whole works. I don't have a VOR or any other navigational equipment which adds to the fun.

I didn't know what to expect or what might be the best strategy, and work has been busy so I didn't have time to really come up with and practice a sophisticated strategy. That said, I did have *a* strategy. It was to fly a moderate cruise speed so I could speed up or slow down, and frequently check my groundspeed and progress against my flight plan so that I could speed up or slow down as needed to hit the timed checkpoints.

The good news is that this strategy worked well for time. I was within 15 seconds of my target time (or so I thought), and got one of the two bonus timed checkpoints. I had us calculating groundspeed and timing error every 5-10 miles - more or less constantly - both out of not knowing how often we'd need to do it to avoid getting too far behind or ahead, and also as practice so that we'd be able to do it smoothly and correctly leading up to the final timing.

The bad news is that this strategy didn't fare as well in the face of unexpected headwinds. We departed an hour and a half later than I expected (because of the marine layer taking its time to burn off), but even accounting for that fairly likely possibility the winds were significantly stronger than the forecast called for. I was able to keep time, but at the cost of a higher fuel burn.

The rally rules allow declaring a "fuel vector" for additional fuel (to account for course deviations for safety), before fueling. I should have taken advantage of that, but I didn't realize I would be so far off and also didn't realize how much of an impact it would have. We were tired and anxious to shuttle the plane back to KPAO and drive back for the banquet. If I had even just thrown in a half gallon without fastidious calculations, my score would have been much more competitive.

Although fuel had a bigger impact on our score, we came by that honestly. The more annoying failure was that we *thought* we arrived no more than 15 seconds earlier than our time estimate, but actually we were 74 seconds late. We are not sure how this happened - it seems egregious for the stopwatch to be a whole 90 seconds off after just 2.5 hours, but I observed how careful they were being with timing and the ADS-B data on FlightAware confirms it so we really were working from a different clock for some reason. The device claims an error of no more than ±1 second/hour (which honestly feels like a lot). Flight tests will be happening! Next time, we'll note takeoff time on our phones so we can cross-check the stopwatch when approaching our destination. Maybe we hit a wormhole.

One silly mistake was not doing more research on what the VOR bonus timed checkpoints look like with satellite photos (and maybe printing some out). I knew what to look for from the air for all the other checkpoints, but had overlooked these. I don't have a VOR radio and VORs are not as obvious as say airports and football fields, so that was a little backwards. We never really did see LIN, even though we did get within 2 miles at our estimated time and got credit for it. Yay for reasonably good dead reckoning, I guess!

VFR paper chart flight planning is an art, and I'm always learning things that do and don't work when I try it. I feel like we did pretty well, we were rarely lost, but there were a few times when I really felt adrift because I wasn't confident about the next fix (especially as the winds were not matching the forecast). For example, one fix was a couple miles north of the cooling towers southwest of Eagle's Nest. I knew where the towers were (they're very prominent and I was familiar with them), but I didn't know if I was too far north or whether I'd mistake Eagle's Nest for Rancho Murieta or Van Vleck. And those railroad tracks are much less prominent in real life than on the chart. But if I had planned to fly directly *toward* the cooling towers, then had a compass heading toward Eagle's Nest even if I turned early (e.g. at the intersection of the river/canal and the railroad tracks), I would have had much more confidence.

An example of a successful fix was after LIN, I had a fix at the intersection of a line between Salt Spring Valley Reservoir and Woodward Reservoir, and my course. I mentioned earlier we weren't sure how close to LIN we got but we turned to that heading when we got to the river just south of LIN and it was easy to see we were roughly bisecting the line between those reservoirs. Although there was nothing on the ground beneath us, this was one of the moments I was most confident of where we were and when to mark the time (besides the obvious like flying directly over an airport or football field).

I was surprised how easy it was to come very close to the time from 10 miles away. I knew my groundspeed on that heading from the previous segment, and I knew what my 5 and 1 mile markers were, and I saw the stopwatch and knew what time I wanted to hit. I flew fast, then saw I was going to make it with time to spare and slowed down, and although my final judgement was off by about 15 seconds I almost nailed it with no practice at all. I think if I practiced this technique it would be easy, so long as I arrive at 10 miles close to the target time getting a score of just a few seconds is doable.

On the other hand, I was surprised at how hard it was to remember simple numbers long enough to turn the E6B dial. Distance and speed pairs, I had to ask Katie over and over. It's amazing what goes out the window with a high workload. I imagine this is like what people describe single-pilot IFR is.

For next time, we're going to practice throughout the year. But we already know a few things we'll change. 
1. A better more organized system for checking progress and error. This will evolve but at the moment I'm thinking the key elements will be distance and time, total so far and total remaining (to next time point) as well as leg. And prepopulating them as much as possible for fewer on-the-fly calculations.
2. Fly a constant airspeed at least until the last 20 miles or so, so fuel is close.
3. Which means build in slack in the track so that checkpoints can be hit but headwinds won't blow the time. One of the things in the briefing was "if you circle a checkpoint do it to the left" and I wondered if it was all that hard to identify the checkpoints… but I think it's a technique to plan for a little extra slack in the form of a dogleg or circling a couple times, so if you've had a headwind you just cut that slack short and stay on time. Or if you've had a tailwind, do a little more. I think I'll plan for an unexpected ±15 knot wind, i.e. a ground speed 15 knots less than my expected ground speed. Maybe 10 will be enough.
4. Katie really enjoyed it and is planning to get current and be the pilot on the controls so I can focus entirely on navigation and calculations. This will be a good arrangement as I love this aspect of it and she has no interest in learning to wield the E6B like I do :laughing:

I think you can tell I enjoyed this thoroughly. If you're wondering whether the rally would be fun, I think the answer is yes! Even if you're not as into the nerdy stuff, just flying the course with GPS and trying to get close to your normal flight planning estimates is a lot of fun, and there's a great social aspect to it also. Come join us!
