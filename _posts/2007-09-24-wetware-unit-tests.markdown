<p>This guy's <a href="http://hober.backpackit.com/pub/1233865">personal unit tests</a> idea is pretty funny, but it does give one pause. I think he might be onto something thereâ€”it's probably much more productive to take stock of how you've done in the past day/week than to write/ponder todo lists for the coming day/week,at least as far as these sort of "maintenance" tasks go. Being aware is half the battle, or more, and I like the focus on "how did I do, where do I sit" versus "I'm going to totally do all these things today, yeah! Oh, right after I finish slashdot..."</p>
