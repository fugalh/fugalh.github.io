<p>Sometimes even the best of us can't avoid a chick flick. That's why it's
important to pass it on when we find one worth watching.</p>

<p>There was nothing good in the theater (that we could agree on), so we went to
the video store. Although I wanted to get
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0377107/">Proof</a>, my wife prevailed with <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0425123/">Just Like
Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>What's to like about Just Like Heaven? Jon Heder, The Cure, Reese Witherspoon,
Mark Ruffalo, a story that isn't lame, and Jon Heder.</p>

<p>The story is no Lord of the Rings, but it's fun and not inconsistent.
Inconsistency is a plague of the silver screen these days, and it's nice to see
an unblemished specimen.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo is refreshingly Not Tom Cruise. I was forced to watch 13 Going On
30 once, and he saved my sanity, so I owe him a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon is delightful as ever. I loved her in The Importance of Being
Earnest (an even better chick flick), and I loved her here. </p>

<p>The closing titles roll to The Cure's song of the same name. I wasn't familiar
with the song, but it's now on the list of "The Cure songs I really like." Some
of the other music was deliciously alternative, too.</p>

<p>The real reason to get this film is Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite). This is his
first flick since Napoleon Dynamite, and although his role is minor (<em>IDIOTs</em>),
he's <em>freakin' awesome</em>.</p>

<p>So next time your S.O. wants to rent a chick flick, be proactive and pick up
Just Like Heaven.</p>
