<p>Steve Dibb and I are on <a href="http://wonkabar.org/archives/320">the same page</a> about
full-content RSS feeds. It's good to see some empirical evidence supporting
common sense. And it really is common sense: why do people subscribe to RSS
feeds? So they don't have to manually visit every site they want to keep
abreast of. So what RSS subscriber would <em>want</em> for a site to make them click
through to read it? As with so many things in life, it comes down to treating
your readers right (or customers/users/friends/family/etc).</p>

<p>That said, my apologies for when I recently tried to make a spoiler-free book
review of the latest Harry Potter by using the usually-annoying click-through
trick, and my feed generator ignored me.</p>
