    <p>I long ago left the /. crowd.  You can find the same content and then some on Digg and the crap gets filtered out pretty quickly.  I think sites like Digg are going to kill /., but nobody will really care.</p>

    <p>Do you know anyone that will say they really <em>like</em> /., or just people who read it out of old habit?</p>

<p>For some time now Slashdot has ben getting more and more immature. Or I've been getting less tolerant of immaturity. I'm not sure which.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/12/220227&amp;from=rss">A story run yesterday</a> was the last straw. It's time to move on. I'm removing Slashdot from my RSS feed.</p>

<p>The story was entitled <em>Unrefined "Musician" Gains a Global Audience</em>. Here is the blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"An unskilled musician performed a catchy pop instrumental for more than one
    million YouTube users even though he can't play a lick of drums or piano. The
    22-year-old Norwegian's tool was stop-motion video, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey Slashdot, guess what? If you compose music that people enjoy (i.e. catchy), you don't qualify as unskilled musician. This guy is obviously skilled at many things. He can obviously compose a catchy tune, knows a lot more about drums than I do, is very skilled with a video editing program, has a good comedic sense, and is good with a tracker. I know a number of composition majors at BYU who can play about as much piano, drums, or anything else as this guy. He and they compose music nonetheless and they are skilled musicians. </p>

<p>Skilled performer? No, at least not with those two instruments. But a skilled musician and video creator. Go watch Lesse Gjertsen's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzqumbhfxRo">Amateur</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9698TqtY4A">Hyperactive</a>. They're enjoyable.</p>

<p>Goodbye Slashdot, this reader has decided to leave your unrefined "news site" for the script kiddies.</p>
