<p>With many thanks to Jim Weirich for his <a href="http://onestepback.org/articles/lingo/index.html">excellent
presentation</a>
(which I unfortunately could not experience in person), I present an
<a href="http://asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> <acronym title="domain-specific language">DSL</acronym> called radp. </p>

<p>Asterisk is incredibly cool and powerful, and until now has been
incredibly painful to configure for someone as accostumed to the beauty
of ruby as I am. That all ends today. </p>
