  content: <p>I can second that on Primer.  It's a good how.  If you have *no* idea
    what it's about, then it's going to be a little hard to follow for a while, but
    eventually you get it.  Lotsa science. :)</p>

<p>If you like science fiction--I mean <em>real</em> science fiction, not just a movie
that happens to have a robot or a spaceship in it--then you want to go out and
get <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/">Primer</a> this week. You want to get
it, watch it, watch it again, then watch the director commentary.</p>

<p>I can't possibly do justice to the movie here. It's an amazing, intelligent,
thought-provoking movie. You should watch it. Trust me.</p>

<p>That said, it's not for everyone. People who read this blog should like it.
People who liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369735/">Monster-in-Law</a> almost
certainly will not enjoy it. But it can be fun to watch them squirm so invite
them anyway.</p>
