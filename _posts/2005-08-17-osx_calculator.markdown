<p>I have never seen a default calculator included with the OS that I like. For
that matter, I have never seen a GUI calculator that I like with the exception
of HP emulators (which are too clunky) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/calculate_convert/rpncalculatorwidget.html">the RPN Calculator Dashboard
Widget</a>
(which is great but dashboard currently means heavy swapping because of the RAM
shortage). I have been pleasantly surprised once again by my iBook. Apple's Calculator is a marvel to behold. </p>

<p>It starts out as unassuming as you ever thought the default calculator would be.</p>

<p>Then you explore the menu and find that not only can you use RPN, but you can
do scientific mode. Neat, but not new. (The RPN bit was exciting though)</p>

<p>Wait! What is this Progammer view all about? Oh wow. Easy base conversion, 64-bit binary, 2's complement, every operation you ever needed to make your CS and EE homework a piece of cake. I'm sold!</p>

<p>Ok, one thing does bug me. RPN is hard to work with without a stack. Sorry, the
paper tape doesn't cut it (it might, if it responded to enter). But all in all
the best designed software Calculator I have ever seen. It even beats out bc
and dc thanks to the programmer feature. Still, there's nothing like my HP
48G...</p>
