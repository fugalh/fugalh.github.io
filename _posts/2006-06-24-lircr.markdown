  content: <p>Speaking of 3.mod, don't you think it would be great if cell phones
    could use MikMod ring tones? I was just thinking about using 3.mod as a ringer

<p><a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/lircr-0.1.tar.gz">lircr</a> (pronounced 'lurker') is a <a href="http://lirc.org">LIRC</a>
client library for Ruby. It's simple, it's easy, it's fun. If you got LIRC, get
lircr. I am not responsible if you grow more hair on your index finger or
thumb.</p>

<pre><code>require 'lirc'
lirc = LIRC::Client.new
event = lirc.next
if event.name == "play"
    system "xmms", "/av/music/3.mod"
end
</code></pre>
