<p>31 minutes to a default Ubuntu install on the 12" iBook. Everything went
smoothly, nothing got hosed. I haven't really looked at what is and isn't
supported yet, but I can say that power management is supported to some degree
out of the box. More reports to come, then I will probably install Debian
before I start using the linux partition in earnest, unless I can figure out a
way to mix ubuntu and debian testing that doesn't result in a meltdown. (I have
a couple of ideas)</p>
