<p>I'm a bit of a Bach organ music nut. I have CDs of his <a href="http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/details/44121.asp">complete organ works</a>, and I have the <a href="http://www.cdsheetmusic.com/products/organ.cfm">CD Sheet Music collection</a> of his complete works for organ. </p>

<p>Unfortunately there are quite a few songs that have been attributed to Bach which were probably not written by Bach. These are known as <em>spurious</em> works. Editors generally leave works that they believe to be truly spurious out of compilations, both audio and paper. The problem is, some of these spurious works are delightful, and if they weren't written by Bach then we don't know who did write them. Just try finding "that nice baroque pastoral setting of In Dulci Jubilo for organ written by somebody who we don't know other than we know it's not Bach" in your library. So I prefer the practice of admitting spuriousity and just including it anyway.</p>

<p>I have the bad habit of choosing to learn to play pieces that are in Herrick's collection but are not in CD Sheet Music (supposedly because of spuriousity). BWV 577 the "Gigue" Fugue, and BWV 751 In Dulci Jubilo are two of these. They both happen to be in <a href="http://www.edition-peters.com/php/stock_info.php?section=music&amp;pno=EP248">Edition Peters volume 9</a> but figuring that out via Google was a gargantuan task. In fact I never did find that out from Google, but only by emailing a few organists did I learn that. Once I learned it I was home free because NMSU's library has it (BYU's library doesn't have volume 9, much to my dismay a couple of years ago when I was looking for BWV 577). </p>

<p>Edition Peters is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtext_edition">urtext</a>, so I have decided to make life easier for other bach organ nuts who have an affinity for the tune In Dulci Jubilo, and contributed it to the <a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=884">Mutopia Project</a>. It's typeset using the marvelous program <a href="http://lilypond.org/web/">LilyPond</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a budding organist, this is an easy piece to learn. It's a trio, meaning 3 voices: one for your right hand, one for your left, and one for your feet. The pedal voice is very lethargic, you only have about 4 measures of any movement to speak of that you need to learn. The manuals are not difficult to learn for a moderately accomplished pianist. There are many nuances to articulation and expression that could be focused on, of course, but if you were subconsciously searching for the perfect short Christmas organ tune to learn, this is it. Enjoy!</p>
