    <p>Sounds kind of interesting. Maybe you could post a few screenshots on Flickr?</p>

    <p>I noticed that your blog is powered by Typo. How do you like it?</p>

    <p>Oops, already booted back into OS X. The screenshots would not be all that interesting though, certainly no more interesting than <a href="http://www.wmii.de/shots/20060518.png" rel="nofollow">the ones on the homepage</a>.</p>

    <p>I like Typo a lot.</p>

  content: <p>I realise this is an old post but I'd be interested to know what window
    manager you use instead. I've found exactly the same annoyances as you, as well
    as windows not always focusing on mouseover (sometimes I have to click their titlebars
    to focus them).  Some aspects of WMII really help me to visualise where things
    are without having to think too much about what I want to do next but like you
    say they take simple too far. </p>

    <p>Hi Joe, I mostly use Metacity in GNOME because I don't spend a lot of time in Linux presently. OS X is the best thing I've found for laptop use, for various reasons. Ironically, one of the biggest reasons is that manipulating OS X with the keyboard is so much easier and more consistent than linux. So I use an eyecandy commercial windowing environment because of the keyboard support. Go figure. :-)</p>

    <p>I've never found a WM in linux that holds my attention for more than a few months or a year at best. At this point I would have to say: FVWM (ugly but good), OpenBox, or Metacity, all under GNOME. FVWM can be ok on its own, but it's a lot of effort. I was loyal to WindowMaker for a relatively long time, and it's a good choice too.</p>

    <p>"mod-shift-c is terribly unprecedented for closing windows. mod-w would be a much more consistent choice (yes, ctrl-w does sometimes work even in Windows)"</p>

    <p>It's no problem you can configure that in your wmiirc.</p>

<p>I've been giving  <a href="http://wmii.de">wmii</a> a try. wmii is a window manager from
the "I can do it better than you" school, aka the people that believe people
shouldn't be bothered with managing windows. Managing windows is a waste of
time, let the computer do it dynamically. I like this philosophy, to an extent.
But most of my gripes probably boil down to not drinking enough of their
koolaid.  Without further ado, I bring you the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Like ion, I can be more productive in a coding situation. Other workflows,
like making music, where you want to see a lot of stuff from a lot of
different apps at once, wouldn't work very well unless you had a huge screen.
In those workflows, it's either overlap or die, this tiling stuff just
doesn't cut it.</li>
<li>The concept of a nice filesystem-like interface to the wm is really neat.</li>
<li>Float support (for apps that don't handle resizing well) is much better than in ion.</li>
<li>Tagging</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want my terminals and gvim windows 80 columns wide. No less, no more. I
like them stretching up and down, but I will not tolerate 60 characters just
because that's a nice halfway split of the screen. I don't much like
having it bigger than 80 either, but that's not as big of a deal.</li>
<li>mod1 (alt) is a stupid default for the mod key, and changing it to mod4 was
not a walk in the park.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint for Debian users:</p>

<pre><code>cp -r /etc/X11/wmii-3 ~/.wmii-3  # /etc/X11 wtf?!?! Watch out for the decoy /etc/wmii
sed -i s/mod1/mod4/ ~/.wmii-3/wmiirc
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You have to hold down mod to move windows in floating mode, and even worse
you have to hold down mod and right click to resize. This is a problem on my
iBook where right-click drag is nigh unto impossible. Would it kill them to
support basic title bar moving and drag-the-corner resizing?</li>
<li>mod-shift-c is terribly unprecedented for closing windows. mod-w would be a
much more consistent choice (yes, ctrl-w does sometimes work even in Windows)</li>
<li>Stack mode is ok, but tabs would be better because of the conservation of
vertical space. I'm sure this is simply easier to code, but it's <em>not</em> the
same as tabs.</li>
<li>Keeping the wm under a certain number of LoC is a stupid metric. Keep it
simple, keep it modular, keep it elegant, keep it whatever, but an arbitrary
LoC restriction is silly. I wonder if this isn't already affecting usability
per the previous point (stacking vs. tabs)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, it's a great tiling window manager. I'm afraid that I can't swallow
the tiling window manager paradigm, at least not until I get one of those nice
huge theater-aspect screens. I do have some ideas for a compromise, though. The
first thing is to acknowledge that overlap can be good, and that fixed sizes
(or at least restrictions on sizing) can be good. I picture something involving
layers, sizing respect, and perhaps automatic scaling, to an extent. (can't
that newfangled eyecandy technology do that, theoretically?)</p>
