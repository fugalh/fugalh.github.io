<p>I'm pretty excited about <a href="http://skyvector.com/">SkyVector.com</a>. I love it when the government shares the information we paid for and I love it when a clueful company helps them do that in such a delicious way. Now they just need to make it easy to drag a ruler (e.g. with the right mouse button) between two points and tell you the distance and true course of that line.</p>

<p>This is going on my list of very useful aviation sites. Already on the list are <a href="http://airnav.com">AirNav.com</a>, the excellent online book <a href="http://www.av8n.com/how/">See How It Flies</a>, the NWS <a href="http://www.aviationweather.noaa.gov/">Aviation Weather Center</a>, and <a href="http://www.liveatc.net/">LiveATC.Net</a>.</p>
