When your battery dies while editing a new unsaved file in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, and instead of going to sleep as it should your laptop rudely shuts down, when you boot up and start MacVim again you may begin to panic because it doesn't do the regular <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> recovery dance.

Fear not, all is not lost. It's there ready for recovery. Just type <code>:recover</code>.
