  content: <p>mmm, Mandioca is what it's called in Brasil.  Very common food.  Often
    cooked as you would a potato (fried, mashed, baked).  But they also heavily use
    it in a flour form (farinha) in several food.  Often a nice grainy flour cooked
    up with some bacon, which you put on your beans.  Oh, and they make very heavy
    use of the tapioca flour for their cooking.</p>

    <p>I was just introduced to the wonderful tatse of Yuca. I notices when cooked it acted like a potatoe. My question is where can i find nutrional information about its calories, carbohydrates, sugar. I have refrained from eating potatoes due to its carbohydrates, sugar, etc... i am a diabetic and i am wondering how this will effect my blood sugars. they make the best home fries i have ever had. Please help!

<p>On my mission in Connecticut among the Spanish-speaking peoples of the world, I had many a serving of yuca. Yuca is a delicious tuberous root that most of my peers hated. Many times I tried to ask my hosts if what they were serving was the same thing as yucca, the state "flower" of New Mexico that grows everywhere. I was no stranger to the above-ground part of yucca but I had never heard of anyone eating its roots before. Due to the language barrier, and I suspect the fact that many of these people have probably never seen yucca, I never really did find out.</p>

<p>Fast forward. I live in New Mexico again, and when I go to the grocery store
they are selling yuca root in the produce section, labeled as yucca. So for at
least a year now I've been thinking it must be the same thing, although
probably a specific variety is good for eating. Today I decided to find out
once and for all. I have learned many things. First, yuca is not yucca (and
vice versa). They are botanically unrelated. Yuca is otherwise known as cassava
or manioc. Yucca is otherwise known as that pointy thing in the back yard. Some
varieties of yucca have edible parts, but yuca is the plant that anyone talking
about eating "yucca" is likely to be referring to. Yuca is the basis of tapioca
and is a staple food in many places around the world, but very few Americans
have ever heard of it (aside from tapioca) and probably wouldn't like it
anyway. But it really is good. I'm going to try some recipes and I'll post when
I find one I like.</p>

<p>So let's review. This is yucca:</p>

<p>It is the state flower of New Mexico, it grows all over the place in the
southwest desert, some varieties can grow fast enough to stay on top of the
moving gypsum dunes at White Sands (but hasn't figured out the descent part -
so usually collapses under its own weight when the dune moves on). I like
yucca, it's a nice plant. Genus Yucca, family Agavaceae. Rhymes with yuck-a (as
in, you don't usually eat it).</p>

<p>This is yuca:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/tropical/lecture_26/01m.jpg" alt="yuca"/></p>

<p>AKA cassava or manioc, the root is a staple food and the basis of tapioca, has
cyanide traces when uncooked, grows in the tropics (originally from South
America). Genus Manihot, family Euphorbiaceae. Rhymes with nuke-a (as in, packed
with flavor. Almost).</p>

<p>Why the confusion? My dictionary says the origin of Yucca is from the 16th
century in the Caribbean, denoting cassava. So somebody took the word yuca and
mistakenly applied it to the yucca plant (probably a variety that looked
somewhat like yuca). So there's a long history of confusion. Don't you be
confused no more. If anyone misuses the two terms, be sure to set them
straight.</p>
