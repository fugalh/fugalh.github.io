I have a calendaring dream. I want to publish my availability somewhere where people can see it.

My calendaring at work happens on an Exchange server, which works really nicely with iCal in Snow Leopard. I also do some non-work scheduling with iCal. I shouldn't publish details of work scheduling because that has the potential to leak sensitive information. But there should be no problem with publishing availability.

Alas, I can't figure out how to publish the Exchange information from iCal at all. The publish item in the context menu is greyed out. Although that calendar does have "affects availability" checked, I can't see any way to publish that availability for others to see, which kind of defeats the purpose of availability don't you think?
