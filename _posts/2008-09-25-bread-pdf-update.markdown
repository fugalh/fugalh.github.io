  content: <p>Hans - you've got me into trying to make my own sourdough starter...
    but are you sure the quantities are right?   I mix 2 tablespoons of whole wheat
    flour and 1 tablespoon water, and I get a very dry ball of dough, and after 48
    hours no signs of bubbles!  Yeah, it does smell a bit.  Was wondering if I needed
    loads more water to make it MUCH wetter?</p>

    <p>Hi Mike,</p>

    <p>You're right, that's a mistake. It should be a 1:1 ratio by volume.</p>

    <p>Not that 2:1 doesn't work, though it won't get "bubbly" as you saw—because it's more like dough than batter. I actually went through a stage where I recommended and preferred 2:1—actually 1:1 by weight which is almost the same thing—but I found that it's easier to work with the more liquid start than the dough-like start which gets quite glutenous.</p>

    <p>I have fixed the PDF, please grab a fresh copy.</p>

  content: '[...] modified it (per his instructions) to use the sourdough I received
    a few weeks ago from my friend Hans. I was very pleased with the resulting bagels.
    I think I&#8217;d cook them a little longer next [...]'

<p>I've updated my <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/bread.pdf">bread/sourdough PDF</a> to reflect the recipe and methods I have settled on.</p>

<p>The bread recipe didn't really change, though I adjusted a few minor details in wording, etc. The sourdough pancakes recipe is completely new—the one from <a href="http://joepastry.com/index.php?cat=86">Joe Pastry</a> which is so much better than the one I came up with. The biscuit recipe is the old biscuit recipe from the old sourdough cards that my family got with our start. I don't know if that source has a name or author, but I do have scanned images at <a href="http://hans.fugal.net/sourdough/">http://hans.fugal.net/sourdough/</a>. The consensus of all who eat these biscuits is that they must be served at Thanksgiving dinner in Heaven.</p>
