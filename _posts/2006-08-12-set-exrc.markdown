<p>Let's say you work on more than one project, each of which has different policy
about tabs (e.g. one of the only two sane tab policies: all real tabs or all
spaces). You need vim to behave one way in project A and another way in project
B. You could use modelines, but that's a violation of DRY.</p>

<p>The solution is something I'd often wished for but never realized vim did. <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html#.vimrc"><code>set
exrc</code></a> in your <code>~/.vimrc</code> tells vim to search the current directory for a
<code>.vimrc</code> or <code>.exrc</code> file. You might need a few symlinks (automatable with a
Makefile) to reach all the subdirectories of your project tree, but this will
solve all your problems.</p>
