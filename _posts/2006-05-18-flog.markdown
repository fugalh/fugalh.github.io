  content: <p>flog is a good one</p>
---
<p>A while back I switched my blog from Blosxom to Typo. Typo is really spiffy but
I am not a fan of HTML edit boxes, so I looked for good blog posting software.
I didn't find any, and certainly none that was free, and I was really
comfortable with writing my posts using Markdown in vim, so I decided to write
my own. Thus was born flog, so named because it rhymes with blog and reflects
the true effect that my blog has upon the world. </p>

<p>From the README:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Run <code>flog</code> and edit the post template in <code>$EDITOR</code>. When done, save and exit
    <code>$EDITOR</code> and your post will be submitted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I finally got around to adding the pieces to make it robust enough for general
consumption, and so I am releasing it. You can find it at
<a href="http://hans.fugal.net/src/flog">http://hans.fugal.net/src/flog</a>.</p>

<p>Flog uses the MetaWebLog API, so it should work with a variety of blog software.</p>
