<p>My wife and I enjoy the occasional game of Scrabble. We have too much fun
trying to fake each other out and making each other laugh to bother with
keeping score. One of the best things about playing Scrabble this way is the
words that you can discover. I will often try to play a word that I know
nothing about, but very imaginably could be a real word. It makes me look
smart, or funny, depending on whether it really exists. (This same tactic works
just as well, perhaps better, in Boggle.)</p>

<p>It was in that way that I discovered quoits tonight. I had thought horseshoes
started out with horseshoes, but it turns out to be much older than that, and
in fact is directly related to the discus.</p>
