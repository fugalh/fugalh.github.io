<p>It's actually still election day eve here, but by the time most of you read this it will be November 4. I don't care who you are or how you want to vote, it's important that we all vote. I don't care if you know your candidate(s) will lose. I don't even care if you want to vote for <a href="http://www.superdellforgovernor.com/">SUPERDELL</a>! Get out and vote, if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Then if you have geek tendencies you might enjoy doing what I'll be doing tomorrow night: compare the excellent statistical predictions from <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight.com</a> with how things actually play out. He has an <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/167186">hour-by-hour guide to election night</a> at Newsweek.</p>
