<p>There's a problem with sleep on the iBook G4 with Radeon 9200 under linux. It
will go to sleep just fine, but will not wake up properly.</p>

<p>The problem is related to DRI. If you disable DRI in <code>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</code>
(or <code>xorg.conf</code>), it works great. It also works great if you don't use X at
all, although if you use X once and then exit the problem still exhibits
itself. </p>

<p>The great news here is that you don't need to disable DRI, because there's
an option that will fix things. The magic option is <code>AGPMode</code>, which you want
to set to 4.  Here's my Device section:</p>

<pre><code>Section "Device"
    Identifier "Radeon Mobility 9200 M9+"
    Driver     "radeon"
    Option     "UseFBDev" "on"
    Option     "AGPMode"  "4"
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>Voil&aacute;! Perfect sleep. Supposedly, the kernel is supposed to take care of
that AGP mode stuff but it isn't doing so properly, so in future kernel
versions (I am using 2.6.11.10) it may work without this option. </p>

<p>Working sleep, along with working wireless (I will blog the USB wireless
adapter soon), has made linux a viable alternative to OS X for me. We shall
really see which one I will gravitate towards, now that the showstopping
barriers are gone.</p>
