<p>Ok, scratch that part about Irssix. Irssix is cool but has some issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>pgup/dn don't work from the input box</li>
<li>it automatically scrolls down when something new happens, making it really
difficult to read backlogs. (I hate it when my terminal does this too, btw)</li>
<li>it tends to crash when reconnecting after waking my laptop</li>
</ul>

<p>But <a href="http://www.g1m0.se/macirssi/">macirssi</a> is even better. It does let me
change the font, already comes with a dark background, has more preferences to
set graphically, and doesn't crash. It does look a little funky, though (as in
not really OS X-ish).</p>
