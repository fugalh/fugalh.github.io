<p>I finally got around to watching <a href="http://www.elephantsdream.org/">Elephants Dream</a>. I have to say that I was not impressed.</p>

<p>Ok, I was impressed, very much, by "the machine". I was impressed by some of the surrealism. </p>

<p>But the person animation was basically terrible.  The script (if you can call it that) was silly. The plot was nonexistent. </p>

<p>As a demo for "what blender can do", Elephants Dream is a great piece of work. As a completely random set of interesting surreal scenes, it's interesting. As a creative work, it flops.</p>
