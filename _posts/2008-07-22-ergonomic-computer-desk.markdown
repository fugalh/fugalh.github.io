<p>When you hear ergonomics you may think of slick curvy things, and probably not of homemade plywood computer desks. But my as-yet theoretical desk should be the epitome of ergonomics for me.</p>

<p>I'm 6'4" and very few desks are made with someone my size in mind. Add to that the fact that very few desks are made with ergonomics of any kind in mind, and it's a sorry thing indeed.</p>

<p>We were talking about setting up a workspace where I could go to work and not be in the primary living area (aka the couch), but we've since decided I'll just go to school. But for a brief moment my DIY engines revved up and I dreamed up the perfect ergonomic, cheap, sturdy desk.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I sat in my favorite chair, in the most comfortable/ergonomic position (definitely <em>not</em> straight up) with the height adjusted to give me a nice foot plant with support but not pressure on my legs behind the knees. Then I had Erin help me with the measurements. Keyboard shelf just above the knees, monitor/laptop at eye level and an arms length away, and wide enough for a keyboard, trackball, and open book (width is negotiable if space is tight).</p>

<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mydeskplan/">Kathy's Desk Plan</a>, though I doubt I'll paint mine sky blue. I'll probably stain it. If I can convince Erin to let me build it, that is.</p>

<p>A rather good source for ergonomic info is at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html">Coding Horror</a>. But as I alluded above, my take on ergonomics is slightly different. </p>

<p>First, the only RSI injury I've had was directly caused by resting my forearm on a desk corner (rounded) and using the mouse too much (doing lots of web research). As a keyboardist, I know that the best thing is to not rest your wrists/palm/forearms while typing. The only hope you have of doing this is if the keyboard is low enough that it's about the level of your elbow, or a bit lower. This is the first place most desks go dreadfully wrong. And no, those stupid keyboard trays don't count.</p>

<p>Second, the monitor should be up around eye level and not too close to the face. This is in line with what others say so I won't elaborate.</p>

<p>Third, I simply can not sit up straight for any length of time. It is absolutely impossible, and I believe that even if I could it would be detrimental. Maybe some people are made to sit up straight, I don't know, but I know my body isn't designed that way. Whenever I try it, I end up subconciously resting on my elbows, chin in my palm, with my face right up at the monitor, which is of course bad for my eyes, neck, and wrists. What my body has told me all along seems to jive with <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061127112844.htm">recent research</a>. This is the realm of the chair but I mention it for completeness.</p>

<p>Finally, I find arm rests cause problems in my shoulders, elbows, forearms, etc. I highly prefer a chair without arm rests, or where they are adjusted sufficiently low as to be out of the way when typing (and therefore only used for actual <em>rest</em>). Again, this is a function of the chair.</p>

<p>So there you have it. If your wife lets you make one (and you may need to adjust the measurements to fit your body), let me know how it turns out. </p>
